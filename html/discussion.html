        <h2>Our goals for this project were twofold:</h2> 
        
        <p>1. Create a useful repository which contains presidential State of the Union addresses while highlighting valuable information contained within those historic texts </p>
        
        <p>2. Generate tools that would allow a normal person to quickly and intuitively gather insight based on the content of these texts</p>
        
        <p>With the groundwork for achieving these two goals coming to fruition, we can begin to ask and answer questions as well as perform observations with the help of the tools we’ve generated.</p>
        
        <p>Before going any further, we’d be remiss to not extend a grateful hand of accreditation to another project which both inspired our work and assisted in providing us with code which we adapted to suit the purposes of our project. This group created the InaugAddresses project which examined presidential inaugural addresses in search of interesting themes. Their work has been exceedingly helpful to us, and their site can be found <a href="https://ryanzav3.github.io/InaugAddresses/index.xhtml">here</a> and their repository <a href="https://github.com/ryanzav3/InaugAddresses">here</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>What can we gain from this?</h2> 
        <p>Back to the subject of our own project, we have created a set of tools which can be utilized for researching and gaining insight into a number of questions. We will discuss a few of these now.</p>
        
        <p>What subjects came up most often, and how did this change over time?</p>
        
        <p>The popularity of subjects tended to shift over time, but there were a few whose frequency is significant and notable. Mentions of economy were the most consistent over time, with most presidents dedicating a significant percentage of their address to dealing with economic issues. Interestingly, war was a subject that would suddenly spike from obscurity into relevance before receding just as rapidly; our next question will address this more fully.</p>
        
        <p>Can these changes be explained by outside information?</p>
        
        
        <p>Some of the changes we see have obvious roots in contemporary events, and this should come as no surprise. By examining our graphs, one can comprehend through visual means the way that mentions of certain subjects, particularly war, can wax and wane over time as America joins and exits conflicts.</p>
        
        <h2>Limitations and Areas for Expansion</h2> 
        
        <p>Like any project, ours came with a number of limitations such as limited time and genuine ineptitude, but we feel that we’ve laid a strong groundwork that allows for scalability. Among the largest limitations of our research is the narrow scope of our primary analysis. Expanding the subject to encompass a greater majority of the State of the Union addresses would do a great deal for this project.</p>
        
        <p>One of our suggestions would be to expand the number of subjects included in the initial markup.
            Potential subjects for future markup:</p>
        
        <p>Crime/Law Enforcement (particularly drug crime)</p>
        
        <p>Science</p>
        
        <p>Medicine/Healthcare</p>
        
        <p>Education</p>
