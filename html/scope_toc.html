      <h3>January 30, 1961</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the Congress:</p>
      <p>It is a pleasure to return from whence I came. You are among my oldest
         friends in Washington--and this House is my oldest home. It was here,
         more than 14 years ago, that I first took the oath of Federal office. It
         was here, for 14 years, that I gained both knowledge and inspiration
         from members of both parties in both Houses--from your wise and generous
         leaders--and from the pronouncements which I can vividly recall, sitting
         where you now sit--including the programs of two great Presidents, the
         undimmed eloquence of Churchill, the soaring idealism of Nehru, the
         steadfast words of General de Gaulle. To speak from this same historic
         rostrum is a sobering experience. To be back among so many friends is a
         happy one.</p>
      <p>I am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution
         wisely assigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the
         government; and a President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual
         respect will neither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I
         shall withhold from neither the Congress nor the people any fact or
         report, past, present, or future, which is necessary for an informed
         judgment of our conduct and hazards. I shall neither shift the burden of
         executive decisions to the Congress, nor avoid responsibility for the
         outcome of those decisions.</p>
      <p>I speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity.
         Before my term has ended, we shall have to test anew whether a nation
         organized and governed such as ours can endure. The outcome is by no
         means certain. The answers are by no means clear. All of us
         together--this Administration, this Congress, this nation--must forge
         those answers.</p>
      <p>But today, were I to offer--after little more than a week in
         office--detailed legislation to remedy every national ill, the Congress
         would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty
         of responsibility.</p>
      <p>My remarks, therefore, will be limited. But they will also be candid. To
         state the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the
         past. The prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies, and
         gives a faithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of
         trust. And, while the occasion does not call for another recital of our
         blessings and assets, we do have no greater asset than the willingness
         of a free and determined people, through its elected officials, to face
         all problems frankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear.</p>
      <p>I.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The present state of our economy is disturbing. We take office in the
            wake of seven months of recession, three and one-half years of slack,
            seven years of diminished economic growth, and nine years of falling
            farm income.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Business bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the Great
            Depression. Since 1951 farm income has been squeezed down by 25 percent.
            Save for a brief period in 1958, insured unemployment is at the highest
            peak in our history. <span class="poverty">Of some five and one-half million Americans who are
               without jobs, more than one million have been searching for work for
               more than four months. And during each month some 150,000 workers are
               exhausting their already meager jobless benefit rights.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Nearly one-eighth of those who are without jobs live almost without hope
            in nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled areas. The rest
            include new school graduates unable to use their talents, farmers forced
            to give up their part-time jobs which helped balance their family
            budgets, skilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important
            industries as metals, machinery, automobiles and apparel.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our recovery from the 1958 recession, moreover, was anemic and
            incomplete. Our Gross National Product never regained its full
            potential. Unemployment never returned to normal levels. Maximum use of
            our national industrial capacity was never restored.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In short, the American economy is in trouble. The most resourceful
            industrialized country on earth ranks among the last in the rate of
            economic growth. Since last spring our economic growth rate has actually
            receded. Business investment is in a decline. Profits have fallen below
            predicted levels. Construction is off. A million unsold automobiles are
            in inventory. Fewer people are working--and the average work week has
            shrunk well below 40 hours. Yet prices have continued to rise--so that
            now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to
            buy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Economic prophecy is at best an uncertain art--as demonstrated by the
            prediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be, and I
            quote, "the most prosperous year in our history." Nevertheless,
            forecasts of continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment
            through 1961 and 1962 have been made with alarming unanimity--and this
            Administration does not intend to stand helplessly by.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plants while awaiting the
            end of the recession. We must show the world what a free economy can
            do--to reduce unemployment, to put unused capacity to work, to spur new
            productivity, and to foster higher economic growth within a range of
            sound fiscal policies and relative price stability.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to
            improve unemployment compensation through temporary increases in
            duration on a self-supporting basis--to provide more food for the
            families of the unemployed, and to aid their needy children--to
            redevelop our areas of chronic labor surplus--to expand the services of
            the U.S. Employment Offices--to stimulate housing and construction--to
            secure more purchasing power for our lowest paid workers by raising and
            expanding the minimum wage--to offer tax incentives for sound plant
            investment--to increase the development of our natural resources--to
            encourage price stability--and to take other steps aimed at insuring a
            prompt recovery and paving the way for increased long-range growth.</span> This
         is not a partisan program concentrating on our weaknesses--it is, I
         hope, a national program to realize our national strength.</p>
      <p>II.</p>
      <p>Efficient expansion at home, stimulating the new plant and technology
         that can make our goods more competitive, is also the key to the
         international balance of payments problem. Laying aside all alarmist
         talk and panicky solutions, let us put that knotty problem in its proper
         perspective.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">It is true that, since 1958, the gap between the dollars we spend or
            invest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened.
            This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11
            billion in the 3 years--and holders of dollars abroad converted them to
            gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5 billion
            of gold from our reserve. The 1959 deficit was caused in large part by
            the failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets--the result both
            of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitive prices. The 1960
            deficit, on the other hand, was more the result of an increase in
            private capital outflow seeking new opportunity, higher return or
            speculative advantage abroad.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">Meanwhile this country has continued to bear more than its share of the
               West's military and foreign aid obligations.</span> Under existing policies,
            another deficit of $2 billion is predicted for 1961--and individuals in
            those countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits
            for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remain
            sufficient to meet our own obligations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">All this is cause for concern--but it is not cause for panic. For our
            monetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong. Including
            our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold
            reserve held as backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits,
            we have some $22 billion in total gold stocks and other international
            monetary reserves available--and I now pledge that their full strength
            stands behind the value of the dollar for use if needed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Moreover, we hold large assets abroad--the total owed this nation far
            exceeds the claims upon our reserves--and our exports once again
            substantially exceed our imports.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In short, we need not--and we shall not--take any action to increase the
            dollar price of gold from $35 an ounce--to impose exchange controls--to
            reduce our anti-recession efforts--to fall back on restrictive trade
            policies--or to weaken our commitments around the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any
            fashion. And this is a commitment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Prudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to
            ease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in
            world affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our
            ability to pay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and
            cooperative efforts with our allies will get underway immediately--aimed
            at attracting foreign investment and travel to this country--promoting
            American exports, at stable prices and with more liberal government
            guarantees and financing--curbing tax and customs loopholes that
            encourage undue spending of private dollars abroad--and (through OECD,
            NATO and otherwise) sharing with our allies all efforts to provide for
            the common defense of the free world and the hopes for growth of the
            less developed lands. <span class="war">While the current deficit lasts, ways will be
               found to ease our dollar outlays abroad without placing the full burden
               on the families of men whom we have asked to serve our Flag overseas.</span></span></p>
      <p>In short, whatever is required will be done to back up all our efforts
         abroad, and to make certain that, in the future as in the past, the
         dollar is as "sound as a dollar."</p>
      <p>III.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">But more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance.
            The current Federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show a
            net deficit. The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain in
            balance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures
            requested--and only if an earlier and sharper up-turn in the economy
            than my economic advisers now think likely produces the tax revenues
            estimated. Nevertheless, a new Administration must of necessity build on
            the spending and revenue estimates already submitted. Within that
            framework, barring the development of urgent national defense needs or a
            worsening of the economy, it is my current intention to advocate a
            program of expenditures which, including revenues from a stimulation of
            the economy, will not of and by themselves unbalance the earlier Budget.</span></p>
      <p>However, we will do what must be done. For our national household is
         cluttered with unfinished and neglected tasks. <span class="poverty">Our cities are being
            engulfed in squalor. Twelve long years after Congress declared our goal
            to be "a decent home and a suitable environment for every American
            family," we still have 25 million Americans living in substandard homes.
            A new housing program under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department
            will be needed this year.</span></p>
      <p>Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly
         have room for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to
         teach. One third of our most promising high school graduates are
         financially unable to continue the development of their talents. The war
         babies of the 1940's, who overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now
         descending in 1960 upon our colleges--with two college students for
         every one, ten years from now--and our colleges are ill prepared. We
         lack the scientists, the engineers and the teachers our world
         obligations require. We have neglected oceanography, saline water
         conversion, and the basic research that lies at the root of all
         progress. <span class="economy">Federal grants for both higher and public school education can
            no longer be delayed.</span></p>
      <p>Medical research has achieved new wonders--but these wonders are too
         often beyond the reach of too many people, owing to a lack of income
         (particularly among the aged), a lack of hospital beds, a lack of
         nursing homes and a lack of doctors and dentists. Measures to provide
         health care for the aged under Social Security, and to increase the
         supply of both facilities and personnel, must be undertaken this year.</p>
      <p>Our supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes
         cost the taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential
         that we have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The
         denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on
         account of race--at the ballot box and elsewhere--disturbs the national
         conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our
         democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in
         private business has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public
         business. A host of problems and projects in all 50 States, though not
         possible to include in this Message, deserves--and will receive--the
         attention of both the Congress and the Executive Branch. On most of
         these matters, Messages will be sent to the Congress within the next two
         weeks.</p>
      <p>IV.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us
            around the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his
            party, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to
            be staggered upon learning--even in this brief 10 day period--the harsh
            enormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four
            years. Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more
            difficult. Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as
            weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform
            the Congress that our analyses over the last ten days make it clear
            that--in each of the principal areas of crisis--the tide of events has
            been running out and time has not been our friend.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Asia, the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the
            security of the entire area--from the borders of India and South Viet
            Nam to the jungles of Laos, struggling to protect its newly-won
            independence. We seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia, and, indeed, in
            all of the world--freedom for the people and independence for the
            government. And this Nation shall persevere in our pursuit of these
            objectives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Africa, the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife, political
            unrest and public disorder. We shall continue to support the heroic
            efforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order--efforts which
            are now endangered by mounting tensions, unsolved problems, and
            decreasing support from many member states.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's
            peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90
            miles from our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's
            drive for a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign
            and domestic tyrannies. <span class="economy">Cuban social and economic reform should be
               encouraged. Questions of economic and trade policy can always be
               negotiated.</span> But Communist domination in this Hemisphere can never be
            negotiated.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are pledged to work with our sister Republics to free the Americas of
            all such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of
            a free hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the
            Arctic Circle.</span></p>
      <p>In Europe our alliances are unfulfilled and in some disarray. <span class="economy">The unity
            of NATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by
            national interest.</span> It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor
         fully achieved a common outlook. Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its
         own the mutual problems now facing us in defense, foreign aid, monetary
         reserves, and a host of other areas; and our close ties with those whose
         hopes and interests we share are among this Nation's most powerful
         assets.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold
            War--but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet
            Union and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing that
            either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination--ambitions
            which they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary,
            our task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be
            profitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful
            competition--for prestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even
            for men's minds--is something else again. For if Freedom and Communism
            were to compete for man's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look
            to the future with ever increasing confidence.</span></p>
      <p>To meet this array of challenges--to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on
         the world scene--we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of
         tools: <span class="war">military</span>, <span class="economy">economic</span> and <span class="diplomacy">political</span>.</p>
      <p>One must not overshadow the other. On the Presidential Coat of Arms, the
         American eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his
         left he holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to
         both.</p>
      <p><span class="war">First, we must strengthen our military tools. We are moving into a
            period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military
            and diplomatic possibilities require a Free World force so powerful as
            to make any aggression clearly futile. Yet in the past, lack of a
            consistent, coherent military strategy, the absence of basic assumptions
            about our national requirements and the faulty estimates and duplication
            arising from inter-service rivalries have all made it difficult to
            assess accurately how adequate--or inadequate--our defenses really are.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I have, therefore, instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our
            entire defense strategy--our ability to fulfill our commitments--the
            effectiveness, vulnerability, and dispersal of our strategic bases,
            forces and warning systems--the efficiency and economy of our operation
            and organization--the elimination of obsolete bases and
            installations--and the adequacy, modernization and mobility of our
            present conventional and nuclear forces and weapons systems in the light
            of present and future dangers. I have asked for preliminary conclusions
            by the end of February--and I then shall recommend whatever legislative,
            budgetary or executive action is needed in the light of these
            conclusions.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In the meantime, I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate
            immediately three new steps most clearly needed now:</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">First, I have directed prompt attention to increase our air-lift
            capacity. Obtaining additional air transport mobility--and obtaining it
            now--will better assure the ability of our conventional forces to
            respond, with discrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on
            the globe at any moment's notice. In particular it will enable us to
            meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our forces by starting
            limited wars in widely scattered parts of the globe.</span></p>
      <p>(b) <span class="war">I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine
            program. Using unobligated ship-building funds now (to let contracts
            originally scheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on
            station--at least nine months earlier than planned--substantially more
            units of a crucial deterrent--a fleet that will never attack first, but
            possess sufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to
            discourage any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security.</span></p>
      <p>(c) <span class="war">I have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile
            program. Until the Secretary of Defense's reappraisal is completed, the
            emphasis here will be largely on improved organization and
            decision-making--on cutting down the wasteful duplications and the
            time-lag that have handicapped our whole family of missiles. If we are
            to keep the peace, we need an invulnerable missile force powerful enough
            to deter any aggressor from even threatening an attack that he would
            know could not destroy enough of our force to prevent his own
            destruction. For as I said upon taking the oath of office: "Only when
            our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that
            they will never be employed."</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Secondly, we must improve our economic tools. <span class="diplomacy">Our role is essential and
               unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for the
               entire non-communist world, helping other nations build the strength to
               meet their own problems, to satisfy their own aspirations--to surmount
               their own dangers. The problems in achieving this goal are towering and
               unprecedented--the response must be towering and unprecedented as well,
               much as Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years, which
               brought such fruitful results.</span></span></p>
      <p>(a) <span class="diplomacy">I intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and
            more effective program for assisting the economic, educational and
            social development of other countries and continents. That program must
            stimulate and take more effectively into account the contributions of
            our allies, and provide central policy direction for all our own
            programs that now so often overlap, conflict or diffuse our energies and
            resources. Such a program, compared to past programs, will require</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--more flexibility for short run emergencies</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--more commitment to long term development--new attention to education
            at all levels--greater emphasis on the recipient nation's role, their
            effort, their purpose, <span class="civil-rights">with greater social justice for their people,</span>
            broader distribution and participation by their people and more
            efficient public administration and <span class="economy">more efficient tax systems of their
               own</span></span>
         
         
         <span class="infra">--and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of
            a piecemeal approach.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I hope the Senate will take early action approving the Convention
            establishing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
            This will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies this
            development effort--working toward the time when each nation will
            contribute in proportion to its ability to pay. For, while we are
            prepared to assume our full share of these huge burdens, we cannot and
            must not be expected to bear them alone.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">To our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance for
            progress--alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin
            America, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of
            economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions
            of culture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this
            time in that alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following:</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">--That the Congress appropriate in full the $500 million fund pledged by
               the Act of Bogota, to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War, but
               as a first step in the sound development of the Americas.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--That a new Inter-Departmental Task Force be established under the
            leadership of the Department of State, to coordinate at the highest
            level all policies and programs of concern to the Americas.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members,
            strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to
            prevent foreign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--That, in cooperation with other nations, we launch a new hemispheric
            attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities to all
            levels; and, finally,</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--That a Food-for-Peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America to
            explore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help end
            hunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our own
            hemisphere.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This Administration is expanding its Food-for-Peace Program in every
            possible way. The product of our abundance must be used more effectively
            to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe.
            And I have asked the Director of this Program to recommend additional
            ways in which these surpluses can advance the interests of world
            peace--including the establishment of world food reserves.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">An even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men
            and women--not only on our college campuses but in every age group--who
            have indicated their desire to contribute their skills, their efforts,
            and a part of their lives to the fight for world order. We can mobilize
            this talent through the formation of a National Peace Corps, enlisting
            the services of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign
            lands meet their urgent needs for trained personnel.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Finally, while our attention is centered on the development of the non-
            communist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom
            and welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared to
            help re-establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress
            for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever
            this is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require
            amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I
            proposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last
            summer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the
            possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that
            will demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people
            of Poland.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Third, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools--the means of
            cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must
            ultimately rest.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmament
            effort--to increase our programs of research and study--and to make arms
            control a central goal of our national policy under my direction. <span class="war">The
               deadly arms race, and the huge resources it absorbs, have too long
               overshadowed all else we must do. We must prevent that arms race from
               spreading to new nations, to new nuclear powers and to the reaches of
               outer space.</span> We must make certain that our negotiators are better
            informed and better prepared--to formulate workable proposals of our own
            and to make sound judgments about the proposals of others.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable
            delay in the talks on a nuclear test ban--and it is our intention to
            resume negotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation
            that is equally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to
            end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it. In
            recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its
            membership</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the U.N.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">--we shall help insure that it is properly financed.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the
            Secretary-General is maintained.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the
            world--to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is far
            more essential to their security than it is to ours--the only body in
            the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every
            nation has an equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not
            according to the strength of its armies but according to the strength of
            its ideas. It deserves the support of all.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Finally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible
            areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations "to invoke
            the wonders of science instead of its terrors." Specifically, I now
            invite all nations--including the Soviet Union--to join with us in
            developing a weather prediction program, in a new communications
            satellite program and in preparation for probing the distant planets of
            Mars and Venus, probes which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of
            the universe.</span></p>
      <p>Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space,
         while the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles
         into orbit. <span class="diplomacy">Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations
            by removing these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of
            the Cold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet
            Union and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the
            fruits of this new knowledge available to all--and, beyond that, in an
            effort to extend farm technology to hungry nations--to wipe out
            disease--to increase the exchanges of scientists and their
            knowledge--and to make our own laboratories available to technicians of
            other lands who lack the facilities to pursue their own work. Where
            nature makes natural allies of us all, we can demonstrate that
            beneficial relations are possible even with those with whom we most
            deeply disagree--and this must someday be the basis of world peace and
            world law.</span></p>
      <p>V.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I have commented on the state of the domestic economy, our balance of
            payments, our Federal and social budget and the state of the world.</span> I
         would like to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the
         Executive branch. We have found it full of honest and useful public
         servants--but their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action
         is needed has too often been muffled in the morass of committees,
         timidities and fictitious theories which have created a growing gap
         between decision and execution, between planning and reality. In a time
         of rapidly deteriorating situations at home and abroad, this is bad for
         the public service and particularly bad for the country; and we mean to
         make a change.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuous
            encouragement of initiative, responsibility and energy in serving the
            public interest.</span> Let every public servant know, whether his post is high
         or low, that a man's rank and reputation in this Administration will be
         determined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of his
         staff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this
         Administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring--that we greet
         healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public
         service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who
         works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any
         level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years: "I
         served the United States government in that hour of our nation's need."</p>
      <p>For only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can
         we bring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead. Our
         problems are critical. The tide is unfavorable. The news will be worse
         before it is better. And while hoping and working for the best, we
         should prepare ourselves now for the worst.</p>
      <p>We cannot escape our dangers--neither must we let them drive us into
         panic or narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance
         of power already rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are
         sharply divided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the
         techniques of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill
         discipline and ardor in its servants--while the blessings of liberty
         have too often stood for privilege, materialism and a life of ease.</p>
      <p>But I have a different view of liberty.</p>
      <p>Life in 1961 will not be easy. Wishing it, predicting it, even asking
         for it, will not make it so. There will be further setbacks before the
         tide is turned. But turn it we must. <span class="diplomacy">The hopes of all mankind rest upon
            us--not simply upon those of us in this chamber, but upon the peasant in
            Laos, the fisherman in Nigeria, the exile from Cuba, the spirit that
            moves every man and Nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the
            future.</span> And in the final analysis, they rest most of all upon the pride
         and perseverance of our fellow citizens of the great Republic.</p>
      <p>In the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today,
         closing his final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, "We pray
         that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given
         us."

      <h3>January 11, 1962</h3>
      <p>Mr. Vice President, my old colleague from Massachusetts and your new
         Speaker, John McCormack, Members of the 87th Congress, ladies and
         gentlemen:</p>
      <p>This week we begin anew our joint and separate efforts to build the
         American future. But, sadly, we build without a man who linked a long
         past with the present and looked strongly to the future. "Mister Sam"
         Rayburn is gone. Neither this House nor the Nation is the same without
         him.</p>
      <p>Members of the Congress, the Constitution makes us not rivals for power
         but partners for progress. We are all trustees for the American people,
         custodians of the American heritage. It is my task to report the State
         of the Union--to improve it is the task of us all.</p>
      <p>In the past year, I have traveled not only across our own land but to
         other lands--to the North and the South, and across the seas. And I have
         found--as I am sure you have, in your travels--that people everywhere,
         in spite of occasional disappointments, look to us--not to our wealth or
         power, but to the splendor of our ideals. For our Nation is commissioned
         by history to be either an observer of freedom's failure or the cause of
         its success. Our overriding obligation in the months ahead is to fulfill
         the world's hopes by fulfilling our own faith.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I. STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY</span></p>
      <p>That task must begin at home. For if we cannot fulfill our own ideals
         here, we cannot expect others to accept them. And when the youngest
         child alive today has grown to the cares of manhood, our position in the
         world will be determined first of all by what provisions we make
         today--for his education, his health, and his opportunities for a good
         home and a good job and a good life.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">At home, we began the year in the valley of recession--we completed it
            on the high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new
            Congressionally approved or Administratively increased stimulants to our
            economy, the number of major surplus labor areas has declined from 101
            to 60; non-agricultural employment has increased by more than a million
            jobs; and the average factory work-week has risen to well over 40 hours.
            At year's end the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a "stumbling
            horse" was racing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and
            industrial production.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We are gratified--but we are not satisfied. <span class="poverty">Too many unemployed are
               still looking for the blessings of prosperity.</span> As those who leave our
            schools and farms demand new jobs, automation takes old jobs away. To
            expand our growth and job opportunities, I urge on the Congress three
            measures:</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">(1) First, the Manpower Training and Development Act, to stop the waste
            of able-bodied men and women who want to work, but whose only skill has
            been replaced by a machine, or moved with a mill, or shut down with a
            mine;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">(2) Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and
            place not only the one million young Americans who are both out of
            school and out of work, but the twenty-six million young Americans
            entering the labor market in this decade; and</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">(3) Third, the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery and
            equipment, which, combined with planned revisions of depreciation
            allowances, will spur our modernization, our growth, and our ability to
            compete abroad.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Moreover--pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery--let
            us not forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last 7
            years. The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining--by
            filling three basic gaps in our anti-recession protection.</span> We need:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">(1) First, Presidential stand-by authority, subject to Congressional
            veto, to adjust personal income tax rates downward within a specified
            range and time, to slow down an economic decline before it has dragged
            us all down;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">(2) Second, Presidential stand-by authority, upon a given rise in the
               rate of unemployment,</span> to accelerate Federal and federally-aided capital
            improvement programs;</span> and</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">(3) Third, a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensation
               system--to maintain for our fellow citizens searching for a job who
               cannot find it, their purchasing power and their living standards
               without constant resort</span>--as we have seen in recent years by the Congress
            and the Administrations--to temporary supplements.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">If we enact this six-part program, we can show the whole world that a
               free economy need not be an unstable economy--that a free system need
               not leave men unemployed--and that a free society is not only the most
               productive but the most stable form of organization yet fashioned by
               man.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">II. FIGHTING INFLATION</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">But recession is only one enemy of a free economy--inflation is another.
            Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices
            held almost steady--and wholesale prices declined. This is the best
            record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery
            since the end of World War II.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Inflation too often follows in the shadow of growth--while price
            stability is made easy by stagnation or controls. But we mean to
            maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public
            spirit of business and labor--keeping their total increases in wages and
            profits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test
            to guide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them--for
            their country's interest, and for their own--to apply the test of the
            public interest to these transactions.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Within this same framework of growth and wage-price stability:</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--This administration has helped keep our economy competitive by
            widening the access of small business to credit and Government
            contracts, and by stepping up the drive against monopoly, price-fixing,
            and racketeering;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--We will submit a Federal Pay Reform bill aimed at giving our
            classified, postal, and other employees new pay scales more comparable
            to those of private industry;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level
            incurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally,</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--I am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced Federal Budget.</span></p>
      <p>This is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on
         appropriations, and on three sources of income in particular:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">(1) First, an increase in postal rates, to end the postal deficit;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">(2) Second, passage of the tax reforms previously urged, to remove
            unwarranted tax preferences, and to apply to dividends and to interest
            the same withholding requirements we have long applied to wages; and</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">(3) Third, extension of the present excise and corporation tax rates,
            except for those changes--which will be recommended in a
            message--affecting transportation.</span></p>
      <p>III. GETTING AMERICA MOVING</p>
      <p>But a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget.
         <span class="infra">They require progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify
            our strength.</span></p>
      <p>CITIES</p>
      <p><span class="infra">A strong America depends on its cities--America's glory, and sometimes
            America's shame. To substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for
            decay, we have stepped up existing urban renewal and housing programs,
            and launched new ones--redoubled the attack on water pollution--speeded
            aid to airports, hospitals, highways, and our declining mass transit
            systems--and secured new weapons to combat organized crime,
            racketeering, and youth delinquency, assisted by the coordinated and
            hard-hitting efforts of our investigative services: the FBI, the
            Internal Revenue, the Bureau of Narcotics, and many others. We shall
            need further anti-crime, mass transit, and transportation
            legislation--and new tools to fight air pollution. And with all this
            effort under way, both equity and common sense require that our nation's
            urban areas--containing three-fourths of our population--sit as equals
            at the Cabinet table. I urge a new Department of Urban Affairs and
            Housing.</span></p>
      <p>AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES</p>
      <p>A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources.
         American farmers took heart in 1961--from a billion dollar rise in farm
         income--and from a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we
         are still operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, <span class="economy">which
            cost us $1 billion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to
            halt rural poverty or boost farm earnings.</span></p>
      <p>Our task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificent
         productivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution on our own
         countryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm
         failures of the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all.
         Since 1950 our agricultural output per man-hour has actually doubled!
         Without new, realistic measures, it will someday swamp our farmers and
         our taxpayers in a national scandal or a farm depression.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm
            program--tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each
            crop to the long-range needs of the sixties--and designed to prevent
            chaos in the sixties with a program of common sense.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We also need for the sixties--if we are to bequeath our full national
            estate to our heirs--a new long-range conservation and recreation
            program--expansion of our superb national parks and
            forests--preservation of our authentic wilderness areas--new starts on
            water and power projects as our population steadily increases--and
            expanded REA generation and transmission loans.</span></p>
      <p>CIVIL RIGHTS</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights"><span class="economy">But America stands for progress in human rights as well as economic
               affairs,</span> and a strong America requires the assurance of full and equal
            rights to all its citizens, of any race or of any color. This
            Administration has shown as never before how much could be done through
            the full use of Executive powers--through the enforcement of laws
            already passed by the Congress--through persuasion, negotiation, and
            litigation, to secure the constitutional rights of all: the right to
            vote, the right to travel without hindrance across State lines, and the
            right to free public education.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to
            equal employment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors.
            The Vice President's Committee thus created has done much, including the
            voluntary "Plans for Progress" which, in all sections of the country,
            are achieving a quiet but striking success in opening up to all races
            new professional, supervisory, and other job opportunities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">But there is much more to be done--by the Executive, by the courts, and
            by the Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which the
            executive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of
            strengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right
            to vote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary
            devices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and
            poll taxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the
            Emancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the
            Government--and every citizen--portray that "righteousness does exalt a
            nation."</span></p>
      <p>HEALTH AND WELFARE</p>
      <p>Finally, a strong America cannot neglect the aspirations of its
         citizens--the welfare of the needy, the health care of the elderly, the
         education of the young. For we are not developing the Nation's wealth
         for its own sake. Wealth is the means--and people are the ends. All our
         material riches will avail us little if we do not use them to expand the
         opportunities of our people.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Last year, we improved the diet of needy people--provided more hot
            lunches and fresh milk to school children--<span class="infra">built more college
               dormitories--and, for the elderly, expanded private housing, nursing
               homes,</span> health services, and social security. But we have just begun.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">To help those least fortunate of all, I am recommending a new public
            welfare program, stressing services instead of support, rehabilitation
            instead of relief, and training for useful work instead of prolonged
            dependency.</span></p>
      <p>To relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists--and this is a
         matter which should concern us all--and expand research, I urge action
         to aid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish new
         National Institutes of Health.</p>
      <p>To take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a
         mass immunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such
         ancient enemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough,
         and tetanus.</p>
      <p>To protect our consumers from the careless and the unscrupulous, I shall
         recommend improvements in the Food and Drug laws--strengthening
         inspection and standards, halting unsafe and worthless products,
         preventing misleading labels, and cracking down on the illicit sale of
         habit-forming drugs.</p>
      <p>But in matters of health, no piece of unfinished business is more
         important or more urgent than the enactment under the social security
         system of health insurance for the aged.</p>
      <p>For our older citizens have longer and more frequent illnesses, higher
         hospital and medical bills and too little income to pay them. Private
         health insurance helps very few--for its cost is high and its coverage
         limited. Public welfare cannot help those too proud to seek relief but
         hard-pressed to pay their own bills. Nor can their children or
         grandchildren always sacrifice their own health budgets to meet this
         constant drain.</p>
      <p>Social security has long helped to meet the hardships of retirement,
         death, and disability. I now urge that its coverage be extended without
         further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly.</p>
      <p>EDUCATION</p>
      <p>Equally important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eight
         million adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This
         is a disturbing figure--reflected in Selective Service rejection
         rates--reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommend
         plans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.</p>
      <p>I shall also recommend bills to improve educational quality, to
         stimulate the arts, and, at the college level, to provide Federal loans
         for the construction of academic facilities and Federally financed
         scholarships.</p>
      <p>If this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high
         school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yet
         nearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college.
         Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10
         years. <span class="economy">The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical
            levels--now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our
            families earn less than $5,000.</span> They cannot afford such costs--but this
         Nation cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its
         brainpower.</p>
      <p>But excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent
         to the Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school
         construction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed
         the Senate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum
         amount required by our needs and--in terms of across-the-board aid--the
         maximum scope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason
         to weaken or withdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session.</p>
      <p>"Civilization," said H. G. Wells, "is a race between education and
         catastrophe." It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner
         of that race.</p>
      <p>These are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or
         grievances in our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions
         and the foundation of our hopes. "I believe in democracy," said Woodrow
         Wilson, "because it releases the energy of every human being." The
         dynamic of democracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and
         the policy of this administration is to give to the individual the
         opportunity to realize his own highest possibilities.</p>
      <p>Our program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive
         employment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational
         exclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and
         welfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the
         individual the source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full
         promise of American life.</p>
      <p>IV. OUR GOALS ABROAD</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">All of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. <span class="war">Since
               the close of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and
               tormented mankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher
               standard of living, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries.
               It is our belief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not
               his master.</span></span></p>
      <p>This basic clash of ideas and wills is but one of the forces reshaping
         our globe--swept as it is by the tides of hope and fear, by crises in
         the headlines today that become mere footnotes tomorrow. Both the
         successes and the setbacks of the past year remain on our agenda of
         unfinished business. For every apparent blessing contains the seeds of
         danger--every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope--and the one
         unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Yet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free
            and independent states--free to choose their own future and their own
            system, so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.</span></p>
      <p>Some may choose forms and ways that we would not choose for
         ourselves--but it is not for us that they are choosing. We can welcome
         diversity--the Communists cannot. For we offer a world of choice--they
         offer the world of coercion. And the way of the past shows clearly that
         freedom, not coercion, is the wave of the future. At times our goal has
         been obscured by crisis or endangered by conflict--but it draws
         sustenance from five basic sources of strength:</p>
      <p>--the moral and physical strength of the United States;</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the united strength of the Atlantic Community;</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the regional strength of our Hemispheric relations;</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the creative strength of our efforts in the new and developing
            nations;</span> and</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">V. OUR MILITARY STRENGTH</span></p>
      <p>Our moral and physical strength begins at home as already discussed. But
         it includes our military strength as well. So long as fanaticism and
         fear brood over the affairs of men, we must arm to deter others from
         aggression.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In the past 12 months our military posture has steadily improved. We
            increased the previous defense budget by 15 percent--not in the
            expectation of war but for the preservation of peace. We more than
            doubled our acquisition rate of Polaris submarines--we doubled the
            production capacity for Minuteman missiles--and increased by 50 percent
            the number of manned bombers standing ready on a 15 minute alert. This
            year the combined force levels planned under our new Defense
            budget--including nearly three hundred additional Polaris and Minuteman
            missiles--have been precisely calculated to insure the continuing
            strength of our nuclear deterrent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But our strength may be tested at many levels. We intend to have at all
            times the capacity to resist non-nuclear or limited attacks--as a
            complement to our nuclear capacity, not as a substitute. We have
            rejected any all-or-nothing posture which would leave no choice but
            inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Thus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's
            strategic reserve--increased our troops in Europe--built up the
            Marines--added new sealift and airlift capacity--modernized our weapons
            and ammunition--expanded our anti-guerrilla forces--and increased the
            active fleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by
            nearly a dozen wings.</span></p>
      <p>Because we needed to reach this higher long-term level of readiness more
         quickly, 155,000 members of the Reserve and National Guard were
         activated under the Act of this Congress. Some disruptions and distress
         were inevitable. But the overwhelming majority bear their burdens--and
         their Nation's burdens--with admirable and traditional devotion.</p>
      <p>In the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised--two Army
         Divisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty--and
         substantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the
         procurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning
         efforts. The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is
         under way, identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; <span class="war">and I
            urge your approval of Federal incentives for the construction of public
            fall-out shelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.</span></p>
      <p>VI. THE UNITED NATIONS</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But arms alone are not enough to keep the peace--it must be kept by men.
            Our instrument and our hope is the United Nations--and I see little
            merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world
            instrument because they dislike our imperfect world. For the troubles of
            a world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself.
            And if the organization is weakened, these troubles can only increase.
            We may not always agree with every detailed action taken by every
            officer of the United Nations, or with every voting majority. But as an
            institution, it should have in the future, as it has had in the past
            since its inception, no stronger or more faithful member than the United
            States of America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In 1961 the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced.
            And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in
            the seat of Hammarskjold--or Red China inside the Assembly--have seen
            instead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully
            independent Secretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles
            on disarmament --for peace-keeping in outer space--for a decade of
            development effort--the UN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Eighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN
            with its gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos--or certain
            big-power confrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks,
            to us and to others. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful
            conciliation within a united Congo. This is the objective of our policy
            in this important area.</span></p>
      <p>No policeman is universally popular--particularly when he uses his stick
         to restore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing to
         contribute their votes and their views--but very little else--have
         created a serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN
         assessments. Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their
         votes--and a new UN Bond issue, financing special operations for the
         next 18 months, is to be repaid with interest from these regular
         assessments. This is clearly in our interest. It will not only keep the
         UN solvent, but require all voting members to pay their fair share of
         its activities. Our share of special operations has long been much
         higher than our share of the annual assessment--and the bond issue will
         in effect reduce our disproportionate obligation, and for these reasons,
         I am urging Congress to approve our participation.</p>
      <p>With the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year
         a great new effort in outer space. Our aim is not simply to be first on
         the moon, any more than Charles Lindbergh's real aim was to be the first
         to Paris. His aim was to develop the techniques of our own country and
         other countries in the field of air and the atmosphere, and our
         objective in making this effort, which we hope will place one of our
         citizens on the moon, is to develop in a new frontier of science,
         commerce and cooperation, the position of the United States and the Free
         World.</p>
      <p>This Nation belongs among the first to explore it, and among the
         first--if not the first--we shall be. We are offering our know-how and
         our cooperation to the United Nations. Our satellites will soon be
         providing other nations with improved weather observations. And I shall
         soon send to the Congress a measure to govern the financing and
         operation of an International Communications Satellite system, in a
         manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy.</p>
      <p>But peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone.
         World order will be secured only when the whole world has laid down
         these weapons which seem to offer us present security but threaten the
         future survival of the human race. That armistice day seems very far
         away. The vast resources of this planet are being devoted more and more
         to the means of destroying, instead of enriching, human life.</p>
      <p>But the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his
         execution. Nor has mankind survived the tests and trials of thousands of
         years to surrender everything--including its existence--now. This Nation
         has the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam
         on disarmament and nuclear tests--and we will persist until we prevail,
         until the rule of law has replaced the ever dangerous use of force.</p>
      <p>VII. LATIN AMERICA</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations.
            The Alliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to
            program. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of
            hope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country--among
            workers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help in
            speeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The Latin
            American Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of
            self-help and self-reform.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To support this historic undertaking, I am proposing--under the
            authority contained in the bills of the last session of the Congress--a
            special long-term Alliance for Progress fund of $3 billion. Combined
            with our Food for Peace, Export-Import Bank, and other resources, this
            will provide more than $1 billion a year in new support for the
            Alliance.</span> <span class="diplomacy">In addition, we have increased twelve-fold our Spanish and
            Portuguese language broadcasting in Latin America, and improved
            Hemispheric trade and defense. And while the blight of communism has
            been increasingly exposed and isolated in the Americas, liberty has
            scored a gain. The people of the Dominican Republic, with our firm
            encouragement and help, and those of our sister Republics of this
            Hemisphere, are safely passing through the treacherous course from
            dictatorship through disorder towards democracy.</span></p>
      <p>VIII. THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONS</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our efforts to help other new or developing nations, and to strengthen
            their stand for freedom, have also made progress. A newly unified Agency
            for International Development is reorienting our foreign assistance to
            emphasize long-term development loans instead of grants, more economic
            aid instead of military, individual plans to meet the individual needs
            of the nations, and new standards on what they must do to marshal their
            own resources.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">A newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in
            fourteen countries--supplying trained and dedicated young men and women,
            to give these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of
            the best that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that
            we cannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="poverty">A newly-expanded Food for Peace Program is feeding the hungry of many
               lands with the abundance of our productive farms--providing lunches for
               children in school, wages for economic development, relief for the
               victims of flood and famine, and a better diet for millions whose daily
               bread is their chief concern.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">These programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom.
            The views of their governments may sometimes be very different from
            ours--but events in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us
            never to write off any nation as lost to the Communists. That is the
            lesson of our time. We support the independence of those newer or weaker
            states whose history, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to
            remain outside "entangling alliances"--as we did for more than a
            century. For the independence of nations is a bar to the Communists'
            "grand design"--it is the basis of our own.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the past year, for example, we have urged a neutral and independent
            Laos--regained there a common policy with our major allies--<span class="war">and insisted
               that a cease-fire precede negotiations. While a workable formula for
               supervising its independence is still to be achieved, both the spread of
               war--which might have involved this country</span> also--and a Communist
            occupation have thus far been prevented.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">A satisfactory settlement in Laos would also help to achieve and
               safeguard the peace in Viet-Nam--where the foe is increasing his tactics
               of terror--where our own efforts have been stepped up--and where the
               local government has initiated new programs and reforms to broaden the
               base of resistance. The systematic aggression now bleeding that country
               is not a "war of liberation"--for Viet-Nam is already free. It is a war
               of attempted subjugation--and it will be resisted.</span></span></p>
      <p>IX. THE ATLANTIC COMMUNITY</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Finally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in
            the last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number and
            the readiness of its air, ground, and naval units--both its nuclear and
            non-nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are
            still required. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I
            believe, immeasurably strengthened.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The threat to the brave city of Berlin remains. <span class="civil-rights">In these last 6 months
               the Allies have made it unmistakably clear that our presence in Berlin,
               our free access thereto, and the freedom of two million West Berliners
               would not be surrendered either to force or through appeasement--and to
               maintain those rights and obligations, we are prepared to talk, when
               appropriate, and to fight, if necessary.</span> Every member of NATO stands
            with us in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man's
            will to remain free.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I cannot now predict the course of future negotiations over Berlin. I
            can only say that we are sparing no honorable effort to find a peaceful
            and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem. I believe such a
            resolution can be found, and with it an improvement in our relations
            with the Soviet Union, if only the leaders in the Kremlin will recognize
            the basic rights and interests involved, and the interest of all mankind
            in peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">But the Atlantic Community is no longer concerned with purely military
               aims.</span> As its common undertakings grow at an ever-increasing pace, we
            are, and increasingly will be, partners in aid, trade, defense,
            diplomacy, and monetary affairs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new
            ties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation
            in hundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation,
            of development loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and
            concerted diplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a
            volcanic mountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from
            the accumulating activity of all.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Thus, we in the free world are moving steadily toward unity and
            cooperation, in the teeth of that old Bolshevik prophecy, and at the
            very time when extraordinary rumbles of discord can be heard across the
            Iron Curtain. It is not free societies which bear within them the seeds
            of inevitable disunity.</span></p>
      <p>X. OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS</p>
      <p><span class="economy">On one special problem, of great concern to our friends, and to us, I am
            proud to give the Congress an encouraging report. Our efforts to
            safeguard the dollar are progressing. In the 11 months preceding last
            February 1, we suffered a net loss of nearly $2 billion in gold. In the
            11 months that followed, the loss was just over half a billion dollars.
            And our deficit in our basic transactions with the rest of the
            world--trade, defense, foreign aid, and capital, excluding volatile
            short-term flows--has been reduced from $2 billion for 1960 to about
            one-third that amount for 1961. Speculative fever against the dollar is
            ending--and confidence in the dollar has been restored.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We did not--and could not--achieve these gains through import
            restrictions, <span class="war">troop withdrawals,</span> exchange controls, dollar devaluation
            or choking off domestic recovery. We acted not in panic but in
            perspective. But the problem is not yet solved. Persistently large
            deficits would endanger our economic growth and our military and defense
            commitments abroad. Our goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in our
            balance of payments. With the cooperation of the Congress, business,
            labor, and our major allies, that goal can be reached.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our
            shores, <span class="war">to seek increased military purchases here by our allies,</span> to
            maximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased
            aid from other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws
            which do not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax
            havens, and to urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies
            so as to discourage large and disturbing capital movements.</span></p>
      <p>TRADE</p>
      <p>Above all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand
         our exports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export
         competitive. <span class="economy">Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants--our
            wage and price gains must be consistent with productivity to hold the
            line on prices--our export credit and promotion campaigns for American
            industries must continue to expand.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European
            Common Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will
            arise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external
            tariff similar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will
            we in this country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and
            patterns--or will we wait until events have passed us by?</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We
            need a new law--a wholly new approach--a bold new instrument of American
            trade policy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the
            course of the Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a
            generation to come.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">If we move decisively, our factories and farms can increase their sales
            to their richest, fastest-growing market. Our exports will increase. Our
            balance of payments position will improve. <span class="diplomacy">And we will have forged
               across the Atlantic a trading partnership with vast resources for
               freedom.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">If, on the other hand, we hang back in deference to local economic
               pressures, we will find ourselves cut off from our major allies.
               Industries--and I believe this is most vital--industries will move their
               plants and jobs and capital inside the walls of the Common Market, and
               jobs, therefore, will be lost here in the United States if they cannot
               otherwise compete for its consumers. Our farm surpluses--our balance of
               trade, as you all know, to Europe, the Common Market, in farm products,
               is nearly three or four to one in our favor, amounting to one of the
               best earners of dollars in our balance of payments structure, and
               without entrance to this Market, without the ability to enter it, our
               farm surpluses will pile up in the Middle West, tobacco in the South,
               and other commodities, which have gone through Western Europe for 15
               years. Our balance of payments position will worsen. Our consumers will
               lack a wider choice of goods at lower prices. And millions of American
               workers--whose jobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the
               distribution of exports or imports, or whose jobs will be endangered by
               the movement of our capital to Europe, or whose jobs can be maintained
               only in an expanding economy--these millions of workers in your home
               States and mine will see their real interests sacrificed.</span></span></p>
      <p>Members of the Congress: The United States did not rise to greatness by
         waiting for others to lead. This Nation is the world's foremost
         manufacturer, farmer, banker, consumer, and exporter. <span class="economy">The Common Market
            is moving ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours. The Communist
            economic offensive is under way. The opportunity is ours--the initiative
            is up to us--and I believe that 1962 is the time</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">To seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new
            five-year Trade Expansion Action, far-reaching in scope but designed
            with great care to make certain that its benefits to our people far
            outweigh any risks. <span class="economy">The bill will permit the gradual elimination of
               tariffs here in the United States and in the Common Market on those
               items in which we together supply 80 percent of the world's
               trade--mostly items in which our own ability to compete is demonstrated
               by the fact that we sell abroad, in these items, substantially more than
               we import. This step will make it possible for our major industries to
               compete with their counterparts in Western Europe for access to European
               consumers.</span></span></p>
      <p>On other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to
         50 percent--permitting bargaining by major categories--and provide for
         appropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees
         adjusting to import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards
         provided by peril points, an escape clause, or the National Security
         Amendment. Nor are we abandoning our non-European friends or our
         traditional "most-favored nation" principle. <span class="economy">On the contrary, the bill
            will provide new encouragement for their sale of tropical agricultural
            products, so important to our friends in Latin America, who have long
            depended upon the European market, who now find themselves faced with
            new challenges which we must join with them in overcoming.</span></p>
      <p>Concessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not
         unilateral. <span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise
               unless its outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or
               timidity in our own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe.
               For together we face a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of
               free men everywhere--to build in partnership a new trading community in
               which all free nations may gain from the productive energy of free
               competitive effort.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">These various elements in our foreign policy lead, as I have said, to a
            single goal--the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent
            states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the
            future--a free community of nations, independent but interdependent,
            uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man,
            outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age.</span></p>
      <p>We will not reach that goal today, or tomorrow. We may not reach it in
         our own lifetime. But the quest is the greatest adventure of our
         century. We sometimes chafe at the burden of our obligations, the
         complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices. But there is no
         comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no
         relief in irresponsibility.</p>
      <p>A year ago, in assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few
         generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the
         great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our
         good fortune; and I welcome it now as I did a year ago. For it is the
         fate of this generation--of you in the Congress and of me as
         President--to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did
         not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by
         choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation
         has ever been so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom.</p>
      <p>And in this high endeavor, may God watch over the United States of
         America.

      <h3>January 14, 1963</h3>
      <p>Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 88th Congress:</p>
      <p>I congratulate you all--not merely on your electoral victory but on your
         selected role in history. For you and I are privileged to serve the
         great Republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long
         history. The choices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state
         of the Union for generations yet to come.</p>
      <p>Little more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of the
         United States. In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I
         pledged no easy answers. I pledged--and asked--only toil and dedication.
         These the Congress and the people have given in good measure. And today,
         having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national
         purpose and power--having seen the courageous calm of a united people in
         a perilous hour--and having observed a steady improvement in the
         opportunities and well-being of our citizens--I can report to you that
         the state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life,
         is good.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in
            building a world of order. The people of West Berlin remain both free
            and secure. A settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in
            Laos. <span class="war">The spearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Viet-Nam. The end
               of agony may be in sight in the Congo. The doctrine of troika is dead.
               And, while danger continues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">At home, the recession is behind us. Well over a million more men and
            women are working today than were working 2 years ago. The average
            factory work week is once again more than 40 hours; our industries are
            turning out more goods than ever before; and more than half of the
            manufacturing capacity that lay silent and wasted 100 weeks ago is
            humming with activity.</span></p>
      <p>In short, both at home and abroad, there may now be a temptation to
         relax. For the road has been long, the burden heavy, and the pace
         consistently urgent.</p>
      <p>But we cannot be satisfied to rest here. This is the side of the hill,
         not the top. <span class="war">The mere absence of war is not peace.</span> <span class="economy">The mere absence of
            recession is not growth.</span> We have made a beginning--but we have only
         begun.</p>
      <p>Now the time has come to make the most of our gains--to translate the
         renewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national
         purpose.</p>
      <p>I.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">America has enjoyed 22 months of uninterrupted economic recovery. But
            recovery is not enough. If we are to prevail in the long run, we must
            expand the long-run strength of our economy. We must move along the path
            to a higher rate of growth and full employment</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in
            production, profits, wages, and public revenues. It would mean an end to
            the persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5
            percent for 61 out of the past 62 months--and an end to the growing
            pressures for such restrictive measures as the 35-hour week, which alone
            could increase hourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new
            wage-price spiral of inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with
            other nations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential--the
            enactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in Federal
            income taxes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">For it is increasingly clear--to those in Government, business, and
            labor who are responsible for our economy's success--that our obsolete
            tax system exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits,
            and employment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now
            checks growth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts
            the use of resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our
            Federal revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Now, when the inflationary pressures of the war and the post-war years
            no longer threaten, <span class="economy">and the dollar commands new respect--now</span>, when no
            military crisis strains our resources--now is the time to act</span>. We cannot
         afford to be timid or slow. For this is the most urgent task confronting
         the Congress in 1963.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In an early message, I shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rates
            which will lower liabilities by $13.5 billion. Of this, $11 billion
            results from reducing individual tax rates, which now range between 20
            and 91 percent, to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent, with a
            split in the present first bracket. Two and one-half billion dollars
            results from reducing corporate tax rates, from 52 percent--which gives
            the Government today a majority interest in profits--to the permanent
            pre-Korean level of 47 percent. This is in addition to the more than $2
            billion cut in corporate tax liabilities resulting from last year's
            investment credit and depreciation reform.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary
            deficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years,
            beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second,
            that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes,
            beginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair or
            unnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in the
            net offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that
            budgetary receipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year,
            without any change in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax
            payments of large corporations to a more current time schedule. This
            combined program, by increasing the amount of our national income, will
            in time result in still higher Federal revenues. It is a fiscally
            responsible program--the surest and the soundest way of achieving in
            time a balanced budget in a balanced full employment economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This net reduction in tax liabilities of $10 billion will increase the
            purchasing power of American families and business enterprises in every
            tax bracket, with greatest increase going to our low-income consumers.
            It will, in addition, encourage the initiative and risk-taking on which
            our free system depends--induce more investment, production, and
            capacity use--help provide the 2 million new jobs we need every
            year--and reinforce the American principle of additional reward for
            additional effort.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way
            to achieve these goals.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">No doubt a massive increase in Federal spending could also create jobs
            and growth, but in today's setting, private consumers, employers, and
            investors should be given a full opportunity first.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">No doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy--but a
            long-run problem compels a long-run solution.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">No doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone
            would be of great help--but corporations need customers and job seekers
            need jobs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">No doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simpler and more
            attractive to many--but our growth is also hampered by a host of tax
            inequities and special preferences which have distorted the flow of
            investment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax
            cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make
            possible an equivalent cut in expenditures--but that end is not in view
            and to wait for it would be costly and self-defeating.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In submitting a tax program which will, of course, temporarily increase
            the deficit but can ultimately end it--and in recognition of the need to
            control expenditures--I will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrative
            budget which, while allowing for needed rises in defense, space, and
            fixed interest charges, holds total expenditures for all other purposes
            below this year's level.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This requires the reduction or postponement of many desirable programs,
            the absorption of a large part of last year's Federal pay raise through
            personnel and other economies, the termination of certain installations
            and projects, and the substitution in several programs of private for
            public credit. But I am convinced that the enactment this year of tax
            reduction and tax reform overshadows all other domestic problems in this
            Congress.</span> For we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom, if
         we ever cease to set the pace here at home.</p>
      <p>II.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">Tax reduction alone, however, is not enough to strengthen our society,
               to provide opportunities for the four million Americans who are born
               every year, to improve the lives of 32 million Americans who live on the
               outskirts of poverty.</span></span></p>
      <p>The quality of American life must keep pace with the quantity of
         American goods.</p>
      <p>This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to
         keep within the limitations I have set, it is both possible and
         imperative to adopt other new measures that we cannot afford to
         postpone.</p>
      <p>These measures are based on a series of fundamental premises, grouped
         under four related headings:</p>
      <p>First, we need to strengthen our Nation by investing in our youth.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">The future of any country which is dependent upon the will and wisdom of
            its citizens is damaged, and irreparably damaged, whenever any of its
            children is not educated to the full extent of his talent, from grade
            school through graduate school. Today, an estimated 4 out of every 10
            students in the 5th grade will not even finish high school--and that is
            a waste we cannot afford.</span></p>
      <p>In addition, there is no reason why one million young Americans, out of
         school and out of work, should all remain unwanted and often untrained
         on our city streets when their energies can be put to good use.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Finally, the overseas success of our Peace Corps volunteers, most of
            them young men and women carrying skills and ideas to needy people,</span>
         suggests the merit of a similar corps serving our own community needs:
         in mental hospitals, on Indian reservations, in centers for the aged or
         for young delinquents, in schools for the illiterate or the handicapped.
         As the idealism of our youth has served world peace, so can it serve the
         domestic tranquility.</p>
      <p>Second, we need to strengthen our Nation by safeguarding its health.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Our working men and women, instead of being forced to beg for help from
            public charity once they are old and ill, should start contributing now
            to their own retirement health program through the Social Security
            System.</span></p>
      <p>Moreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little if
         we cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists,
         and nurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern
         urban hospital facilities. Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors
         and dentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 years
         increase the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our
         dental schools by 100 percent.</p>
      <p>Finally, and of deep concern, I believe that the abandonment of the
         mentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial
         institutions too often inflicts on them and on their families a needless
         cruelty which this Nation should not endure. The incidence of mental
         retardation in this country is three times as high as that of Sweden,
         for example--and that figure can and must be reduced.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Third, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights
            of its citizens.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of
            crime in Federal court, regardless of his means.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">And the most precious and powerful right in the world, the right to vote
            in a free American election, must not be denied to any citizen on
            grounds of his race or color. I wish that all qualified Americans
            permitted to vote were willing to vote, but surely in this centennial
            year of Emancipation all those who are willing to vote should always be
            permitted.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Fourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the most
            economical use of its resources and facilities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our economic health depends on healthy transportation arteries; and I
            believe the way to a more modern, economical choice of national
            transportation service is through increased competition and decreased
            regulation.</span> <span class="infra">Local mass transit, faring even worse, is as essential a
            community service as hospitals and highways. Nearly three-fourths of our
            citizens live in urban areas, which occupy only 2 percent of our
            land--and if local transit is to survive and relieve the congestion of
            these cities, it needs Federal stimulation and assistance.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Next, this Government is in the storage and stockpile business to the
            melancholy tune of more than $16 billion. We must continue to support
            farm income, but we should not pile more farm surpluses on top of the
            $7.5 billion we already own. We must maintain a stockpile of strategic
            materials, but the $8.5 billion we have acquired--for reasons both good
            and bad--is much more than we need; and we should be empowered to
            dispose of the excess in ways which will not cause market disruption.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Finally, our already overcrowded national parks and recreation areas
            will have twice as many visitors 10 years from now as they do today. If
            we do not plan today for the future growth of these and other great
            natural assets--not only parks and forests but wildlife and wilderness
            preserves, and water projects of all kinds--<span class="poverty">our children and their
               children will be poorer in every sense of the word.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">These are not domestic concerns alone. For upon our achievement of
            greater vitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in
            the world: our ability to sustain and supply the security of free men
            and nations, our ability to command their respect for our leadership,
            our ability to expand our trade without threat to our balance of
            payments, and our ability to adjust to the changing demands of cold war
            competition and challenge.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach
            abroad. <span class="economy">Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help
               them half as much as a booming U.S. economy. And nothing our opponents
               could do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as
               much as a chronic, lagging U.S. economy.</span> These domestic tasks do not
            divert energy from our security--they provide the very foundation for
            freedom's survival and success.</span></p>
      <p>III.</p>
      <p>Turning to the world outside, it was only a few years ago--in Southeast
         Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, even outer space--that
         communism sought to convey the image of a unified, confident, and
         expanding empire, closing in on a sluggish America and a free world in
         disarray. But few people would hold to that picture today.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In these past months we have reaffirmed the scientific and military
            superiority of freedom. We have doubled our efforts in space, to assure
            us of being first in the future. We have undertaken the most
            far-reaching defense improvements in the peacetime history of this
            country. And we have maintained the frontiers of freedom from Viet-Nam
            to West Berlin.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But complacency or self-congratulation can imperil our security as much
            as the weapons of tyranny. A moment of pause is not a promise of peace.
            Dangerous problems remain from Cuba to the South China Sea. The world's
            prognosis prescribes, in short, not a year's vacation for us, but a year
            of obligation and opportunity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Four special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance,
            the developing nations, the new Sino-Soviet difficulties, and the search
            for worldwide peace.</span></p>
      <p>IV.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">First, how fares the grand alliance? Free Europe is entering into a new
            phase of its long and brilliant history. The era of colonial expansion
            has passed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era of
            interdependence and unity is taking shape. Defying the old prophecies of
            Marx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free
            nations of Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and
            policy in every sphere of activity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">For 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, <span class="economy">both
               political and economic. Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her
               as a welcome partner, not a rival. For the road to world peace and
               freedom is still long, and there are burdens which only full partners
               can share--in supporting the common defense, in expanding world trade,
               in aligning our balance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in
               concerting political and economic policies, and in welcoming to our
               common effort other industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose
               remarkable economic and political development of the 1950's permits it
               now to play on the world scene a major constructive role.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">No doubt differences of opinion will continue to get more attention than
            agreements on action, as Europe moves from independence to more formal
            interdependence. But these are honest differences among honorable
            associates--more real and frequent, in fact, among our Western European
            allies than between them and the United States. For the unity of freedom
            has never relied on uniformity of opinion. But the basic agreement of
            this alliance on fundamental issues continues.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The first task of the alliance remains the common defense. Last month
            Prime Minister Macmillan and I laid plans for a new stage in our long
            cooperative effort, one which aims to assist in the wider task of
            framing a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">The Nassau agreement recognizes that the security of the West is
               indivisible, and so must be our defense. But it also recognizes that
               this is an alliance of proud and sovereign nations, and works best when
               we do not forget it. It recognizes further that the nuclear defense of
               the West is not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone--that
               France will be such a power in the future--and that ways must be found
               without increasing the hazards of nuclear diffusion, to increase the
               role of our other partners in planning, manning, and directing a truly
               multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate NATO
               alliance. Finally, the Nassau agreement recognizes that nuclear defense
               is not enough, that the agreed NATO levels of conventional strength must
               be met, and that the alliance cannot afford to be in a position of
               having to answer every threat with nuclear weapons or nothing.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their full
            realization, to know their place in history. But I believe that, for the
            first time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to
            become a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">The next most pressing concern of the alliance is our common economic
               goals of trade and growth. This Nation continues to be concerned about
               its balance-of-payments deficit, which, despite its decline, remains a
               stubborn and troublesome problem. We believe, moreover, that closer
               economic ties among all free nations are essential to prosperity and
               peace. And neither we nor the members of the European Common Market are
               so affluent that we can long afford to shelter high cost farms or
               factories from the winds of foreign competition, or to restrict the
               channels of trade with other nations of the free world. If the Common
               Market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism, it would
               undermine its own basic principles. This Government means to use the
               authority conferred on it last year by the Congress to encourage trade
               expansion on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world.</span></span></p>
      <p>V.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Second, what of the developing and non-aligned nations? <span class="war">They were
               shocked by the Soviets' sudden and secret attempt to transform Cuba into
               a nuclear striking base--and by Communist China's arrogant invasion of
               India. <span class="civil-rights">They have been reassured by our prompt assistance to India, by
                  our support through the United Nations of the Congo's unification, by
                  our patient search for disarmament, and by the improvement in our
                  treatment of citizens and visitors whose skins do not happen to be
                  white.</span> And as the older colonialism recedes, and the neo-colonialism of
               the Communist powers stands out more starkly than ever, they realize
               more clearly that the issue in the world struggle is not communism
               versus capitalism, but coercion versus free choice.</span></span></p>
      <p>They are beginning to realize that the longing for independence is the
         same the world over, whether it is the independence of West Berlin or
         Viet-Nam. They are beginning to realize that such independence runs
         athwart all Communist ambitions but is in keeping with our own--and that
         our approach to their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful, while
         the Communists are still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">Nevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or
               subversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in
               daily combat with the forces of poverty and despair. It makes little
               sense for us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of
               communism, to spend $50 billion a year to prevent its military
               advance--and then to begrudge spending, largely on American products,
               less than one-tenth of that amount to help other nations strengthen
               their independence and cure the social chaos in which communism has
               always thrived.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I am proud--and I think most Americans are proud--of a mutual defense
            and assistance program, evolved with bipartisan support in three
            administrations, which has, with all its recognized problems,
            contributed to the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty U.N.
            members to gain independence since the Second World War has succumbed to
            Communist control.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I am proud of a program that has helped to arm and feed and clothe
            millions of people who live on the front lines of freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="civil-rights">I am especially proud that this country has put forward for the 60's a
               vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress
               throughout the Americas--the Alliance for Progress.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual
            effort among our close neighbors, but the free states of this
            hemisphere, working in close collaboration, have begun to make this
            alliance a living reality. <span class="poverty">Today it is feeding one out of every four
               school age children in Latin America an extra food ration from our farm
               surplus. It has distributed 1.5 million school books and is building
               17,000 classrooms. It has helped resettle tens of thousands of farm
               families on land they can call their own.</span> It is stimulating our good
            neighbors to more self-help and self-reform--fiscal, social,
            institutional, and land reforms. It is bringing new housing and hope,
            new health and dignity, to millions who were forgotten. The men and
            women of this hemisphere know that the alliance cannot succeed if it is
            only another name for United States handouts--that it can succeed only
            as the Latin American nations themselves devote their best effort to
            fulfilling its goals.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia.
            Wherever nations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help
            them build new bulwarks of freedom. We are not purchasing votes for the
            cold war; we have gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and
            allies alike. What we do ask--and all that we ask--is that our help be
            used to best advantage, and that their own efforts not be diverted by
            needless quarrels with other independent nations.</span></p>
      <p>Despite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the Mutual
         Assistance Program requires a persistent discontent with present
         performance. We have been reorganizing this program to make it a more
         effective, efficient instrument--and that process will continue this
         year.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">But free world development will still be an uphill struggle. Government
            aid can only supplement the role of private investment, trade expansion,
            commodity stabilization, and, above all, internal self-improvement.</span> The
         processes of growth are gradual--bearing fruit in a decade, not a day.
         Our successes will be neither quick nor dramatic. But if these programs
         were ever to be ended, our failures in a dozen countries would be sudden
         and certain.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Neither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weapon
            against poverty.</span> In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose,
         requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism. And nothing
         carries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the far
         corners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.</p>
      <p>A year ago, less than 900 Peace Corps volunteers were on the job. A year
         from now they will number more than 9,000--men and women, aged 18 to 79,
         willing to give 2 years of their lives to helping people in other lands.</p>
      <p>There are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country and
         the cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can
         match. Surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help
         indirectly; by supporting our aid programs; .by opening our doors to
         foreign visitors and diplomats and students; and by proving, day by day,
         by deed as well as word, that we are a just and generous people.</p>
      <p>VI.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Third, what comfort can we take from the increasing strains and tensions
            within the Communist bloc? Here hope must be tempered with caution. For
            the Soviet-Chinese disagreement is over means, not ends. A dispute over
            how best to bury the free world is no grounds for Western rejoicing.</span></p>
      <p>Nevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the
         forces of diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all
         the iron disciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of
         ideology. Marx is proven wrong once again: for it is the closed
         Communist societies, not the free and open societies which carry within
         themselves the seeds of internal disintegration.</p>
      <p>The disarray of the Communist empire has been heightened by two other
         formidable forces. One is the historical force of nationalism--and the
         yearning of all men to be free. <span class="economy">The other is the gross inefficiency of
            their economies.</span> For a closed society is not open to ideas of
         progress--and a police state finds that it cannot command the grain to
         grow.</p>
      <p>New nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only
         compare conditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe,
         North and South Viet-Nam. They need only compare the disillusionment of
         Communist Cuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress. And all
         the world knows that no successful system builds a wall to keep its
         people in and freedom out--and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a
         symbol of Communist failure.</p>
      <p>VII.</p>
      <p>Finally, what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduring
         peace? Again I would counsel caution. I foresee no spectacular reversal
         in Communist methods or goals. But if all these trends and developments
         can persuade the Soviet Union to walk the path of peace, then let her
         know that all free nations will journey with her. <span class="war">But until that choice
            is made, and until the world can develop a reliable system of
            international security, the free peoples have no choice but to keep
            their arms nearby.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">This country, therefore, continues to require the best defense in the
            world--a defense which is suited to the sixties. This means,
            unfortunately, a rising defense budget--for there is no substitute for
            adequate defense, and no "bargain basement" way of achieving it. It
            means the expenditure of more than $15 billion this year on nuclear
            weapons systems alone, a sum which is about equal to the combined
            defense budgets of our European Allies.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civil
            defense, a strengthened anti-guerrilla capacity and, of prime
            importance, more powerful and flexible non-nuclear forces. For threats
            of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression--and a line of
            destroyers in a quarantine, or a division of well-equipped men on a
            border, may be more useful to our real security than the multiplication
            of awesome weapons beyond all rational need.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But our commitment to national safety is not a commitment to expand our
            military establishment indefinitely. We do not dismiss disarmament as
            merely an idle dream. For we believe that, in the end, it is the only
            way to assure the security of all without impairing the interests of
            any. Nor do we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement. While we
            shall never weary in the defense of freedom, neither shall we ever
            abandon the pursuit of peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">In this quest, the United Nations requires our full and continued
               support. Its value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in
               its role in the West New Guinea settlement, in its use as a forum for
               the Cuban crisis, and in its task of unification in the Congo.</span> Today the
            United Nations is primarily the protector of the small and the weak, and
            a safety valve for the strong. Tomorrow it can form the framework for a
            world of law--a world in which no nation dictates the destiny of
            another, and in which the vast resources now devoted to destructive
            means will serve constructive ends.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In short, let our adversaries choose. If they choose peaceful
            competition, they shall have it. <span class="war">If they come to realize that their
               ambitions cannot succeed--if they see their "wars of liberation" and
               subversion will ultimately fail--if they recognize that there is more
               security in accepting inspection than in permitting new nations to
               master the black arts of nuclear war--and if they are willing to turn
               their energies, as we are, to the great unfinished tasks of our own
               peoples--then, surely, the areas of agreement can be very wide indeed: a
               clear understanding about Berlin, stability in Southeast Asia, an end to
               nuclear testing, new checks on surprise or accidental attack, and,
               ultimately, general and complete disarmament.</span></span></p>
      <p>VIII.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">For we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a
               worldwide victory of man. The modern globe is too small, its weapons are
               too destructive, and its disorders are too contagious to permit any
               other kind of victory.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greater
            portion of its national production than any other people in the free
            world. For 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself.
            <span class="war">Through hot wars and cold,</span> through recession and prosperity,</span> through the
         ages of the atom and outer space, the American people have never
         faltered and their faith has never flagged. If at times our actions seem
         to make life difficult for others, it is only because history has made
         life difficult for us all.</p>
      <p>But difficult days need not be dark. I think these are proud and
         memorable days in the cause of peace and freedom. We are proud, for
         example, of Major Rudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of
         Cuba. We salute Specialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of
         South Korea. We pay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in
         Viet-Nam. They are among the many who in this century, far from home,
         have died for our country. Our task now, and the task of all Americans
         is to live up to their commitment.</p>
      <p>My friends: I close on a note of hope. We are not lulled by the
         momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clearer skies above. We know
         the turbulence that lies below, and the storms that are beyond the
         horizon this year. But now the winds of change appear to be blowing more
         strongly than ever, in the world of communism as well as our own. For
         175 years we have sailed with those winds at our back, and with the
         tides of human freedom in our favor. We steer our ship with hope, as
         Thomas Jefferson said, "leaving Fear astern."</p>
      <p>Today we still welcome those winds of change--and we have every reason
         to believe that our tide is running strong. With thanks to Almighty God
         for seeing us through a perilous passage, we ask His help anew in
         guiding the "Good Ship Union."
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_8,_1964" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>Lyndon B. Johnson</h2>
      <h3>January 8, 1964</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House and Senate, my fellow
         Americans:</p>
      <p>I will be brief, for our time is necessarily short and our agenda is
         already long.</p>
      <p>Last year's congressional session was the longest in peacetime history.
         With that foundation, let us work together to make this year's session
         the best in the Nation's history.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for
            civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined; as the session
            which enacted the most far-reaching tax cut of our time; as the session
            which declared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these
            United States;</span> as the session which finally recognized the health needs
         of all our older citizens; <span class="infra">as the session which reformed our tangled
            transportation and transit policies;</span> as the session which achieved the
         most effective, efficient foreign aid program ever; <span class="infra">and as the session
            which helped to build more homes, more schools, more libraries, and more
            hospitals than any single session of Congress in the history of our
            Republic.</span></p>
      <p>All this and more can and must be done. It can be done by this summer,
         and it can be done without any increase in spending. In fact, under the
         budget that I shall shortly submit, it can be done with an actual
         reduction in Federal expenditures and Federal employment.</p>
      <p>We have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation--to prove the
         success of our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and
         abroad who question our purpose and our competence.</p>
      <p>If we fail, if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless,
         senseless quarrels between Democrats and Republicans, or between the
         House and the Senate, or between the South and North, or between the
         Congress and the administration, then history will rightfully judge us
         harshly. But if we succeed, if we can achieve these goals by forging in
         this country a greater sense of union, then, and only then, can we take
         full satisfaction in the State of the Union. II.</p>
      <p>Here in the Congress you can demonstrate effective legislative
         leadership by discharging the public business with clarity and dispatch,
         voting each important proposal up, or voting it down, but at least
         bringing it to a fair and a final vote.</p>
      <p>Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald
         Kennedy--not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are
         right.</p>
      <p>In his memory today, I especially ask all members of my own political
         faith, in this election year, to put your country ahead of your party,
         and to always debate principles; never debate personalities.</p>
      <p>For my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient,
         and honest and frugal. The budget to be submitted to the Congress
         shortly is in full accord with this pledge.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">It will cut our deficit in half--from $10 billion to $4,900 million. It
            will be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since
            1951.</span></p>
      <p>It will call for a substantial reduction in Federal employment, a feat
         accomplished only once before in the last 10 years. While maintaining
         the full strength of our combat defenses, it will call for the lowest
         number of civilian personnel in the Department of Defense since 1950.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">It will call for total expenditures of $97,900 million--compared to
            $98,400 million for the current year, a reduction of more than $500
            million. It will call for new obligational authority of $103,800
            million--a reduction of more than $4 billion below last year's request
            of $107,900 million.</span></p>
      <p>But it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand
         still. Our population is growing. Our economy is more complex. Our
         people's needs are expanding.</p>
      <p>But by closing down obsolete installations, by curtailing less urgent
         programs, by cutting back where cutting back seems to be wise, by
         insisting on a dollar's worth for a dollar spent, I am able to recommend
         in this reduced budget the most Federal support in history for
         education, for health, for retraining the unemployed, and for helping
         the economically and the physically handicapped.</p>
      <p>This budget, and this year's legislative program, are designed to help
         each and every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes--his hopes for a
         fair chance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his
         hopes for a full-time job on full-time pay; his hopes for a decent home
         for his family in a decent community; his hopes for a good school for
         his children with good teachers; and his hopes for security when faced
         with sickness or unemployment or old age. III.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope--some
         because of their poverty, and some because of theft color, and all too
         many because of both. Our task is to help replace their despair with
         opportunity.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on
            poverty in America. I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with
            me in that effort.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy
            will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest
            Nation on earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One
            thousand dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can
            return $40,000 or more in his lifetime.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Poverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization
            and support. But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at
            the State and the local level and must be supported and directed by
            State and local efforts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">For the war against poverty will not be won here in Washington. It must
            be won in the field, in every private home, in every public office, from
            the courthouse to the White House.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">The program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to
            help that one-fifth of all American families with incomes too small to
            even meet their basic needs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="infra">Our chief weapons in a more pinpointed attack will be better schools,
               and better health, and better homes, and better training, and better job
               opportunities to help more Americans, especially young Americans, escape
               from squalor and misery and unemployment rolls where other citizens help
               to carry them.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of poverty, but the
            symptom. The cause may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow
            citizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities, in a lack of
            education and training, in a lack of medical care and housing, in a lack
            of decent communities in which to live and bring up their children.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">But whatever the cause, our joint Federal-local effort must pursue
            poverty, pursue it wherever it exists--in city slums and small towns, in
            sharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps, on Indian Reservations,
            among whites as well as Negroes, among the young as well as the aged, in
            the boom towns and in the depressed areas.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it
            and, above all, to prevent it. No single piece of legislation, however,
            is going to suffice.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed areas of
            Appalachia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless, aimless,
            hopeless youngsters to work on useful projects.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must distribute more food to the needy through a broader food stamp
            program.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must create a National Service Corps to help the economically
            handicapped of our own country as the Peace Corps now helps those
            abroad.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="infra">We must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high-level
               commission on automation. If we have the brain power to invent these
               machines, we have the brain power to make certain that they are a boon
               and not a bane to humanity.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="economy">We must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2
               million workers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.</span></span></p>
      <p>We must, by including special school aid funds as part of our education
         program, improve the quality of teaching, training, and counseling in
         our hardest hit areas.</p>
      <p>We must build more libraries in every area and more hospitals and
         nursing homes under the Hill-Burton Act, and train more nurses to staff
         them.</p>
      <p>We must provide hospital insurance for our older citizens financed by
         every worker and his employer under Social Security, contributing no
         more than $1 a month during the employee's working career to protect him
         in his old age in a dignified manner without cost to the Treasury,
         against the devastating hardship of prolonged or repeated illness.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give
            more help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for
            our poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free
            enterprise system a decent home for every American family.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We must help obtain more modern mass transit within our communities as
            well as low-cost transportation between them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Above all, we must release $11 billion of tax reduction into the private
            spending stream to create new jobs and new markets in every area of this
            land.</span> IV.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">These programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged
            alone.</span> Every American will benefit by the extension of social security
         to cover the hospital costs of their aged parents. <span class="infra">Every American
            community will benefit from the construction or modernization of
            schools, libraries, hospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of
            more nurses and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit.</span>
         <span class="economy">And every individual American taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will
            benefit from the earliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from
            both the new investment it will bring and the new jobs that it will
            create.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">That tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year. Now we need
            action. The new budget clearly allows it. Our taxpayers surely deserve
            it. Our economy strongly demands it. And every month of delay dilutes
            its benefits in 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for
            employment.</span></p>
      <p>For until the bill is signed, its investment incentives cannot be deemed
         certain, and the withholding rate cannot be reduced--and the most
         damaging and devastating thing you can do to any businessman in America
         is to keep him in doubt and to keep him guessing on what our tax policy
         is. <span class="economy">And I say that we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15
            percent our withholding rate.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the
            first of February, if at all possible. For however proud we may be of
            the unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last
            3 years, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause.</span></p>
      <p>In 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70 million job
         mark, but we will soon need more than 75 million jobs. <span class="economy">In 1963 our gross
            national product reached the $600 billion level--$100 billion higher
            than when we took office. But it easily could and it should be still $30
            billion higher today than it is.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Wages and profits and family income are also at their highest levels in
            history--but I would remind you that 4 million workers and 13 percent of
            our industrial capacity are still idle today.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We need a tax cut now to keep this country moving.</span> V.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For our goal is not merely to spread the work. Our goal is to create
            more jobs. I believe the enactment of a 35-hour week would sharply
            increase costs, would invite inflation, would impair our ability to
            compete, and merely share instead of creating employment. But I am
            equally opposed to the 45- or 50-hour week in those industries where
            consistently excessive use of overtime causes increased unemployment.</span></p>
      <p>So, therefore, I recommend legislation authorizing the creation of a
         tripartite industry committee to determine on an industry-by-industry
         basis as to where a higher penalty rate for overtime would increase job
         openings without unduly increasing costs, and authorizing the
         establishment of such higher rates. VI.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Let me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear: All
            of these increased opportunities--in employment, in education, in
            housing, and in every field--must be open to Americans of every color.
            As far as the writ of Federal law will run, we must abolish not some,
            but all racial discrimination. For this is not merely an economic issue,
            or a social, political, or international issue. It is a moral issue, and
            it must be met by the passage this session of the bill now pending in
            the House.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">All members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to
            the public. All members of the public should be equally eligible for
            Federal benefits that are financed by the public. All members of the
            public should have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to
            send their children to good public schools and to contribute their
            talents to the public good.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights"><span class="war">Today, Americans of all races stand side by side in Berlin and in Viet
               Nam. They died side by side in Korea.</span> Surely they can work and eat and
            travel side by side in their own country.</span> VII.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against
            those who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much
            needed skills and those joining their families.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">In establishing preferences, a nation that was built by the immigrants
            of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: "What can you do for
            our country?" But we should not be asking: "In what country were you
            born?"</span> VIII.</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy"><span class="civil-rights">For our ultimate goal is a world without war, a world made safe for
                  diversity, in which all men, goods, and ideas can freely move across
                  every border and every boundary.</span></span></span></p>
      <p>We must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different ways,
         not as partisans, but as patriots.</p>
      <p><span class="war">First, we must maintain--and our reduced defense budget will
            maintain--that margin of military safety and superiority obtained
            through 3 years of steadily increasing both the quality and the quantity
            of our strategic, our conventional, and our antiguerilla forces. In 1964
            we will be better prepared than ever before to defend the cause of
            freedom, whether it is threatened by outright aggression or by the
            infiltration practiced by those in Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and
            men across international borders to foment insurrection. And we must
            continue to use that strength as John Kennedy used it in the Cuban
            crisis and for the test ban treaty--to demonstrate both the futility of
            nuclear war and the possibilities of lasting peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Second, we must take new steps--and we shall make new proposals at
               Geneva--toward the control and the eventual abolition of arms. Even in
               the absence of agreement, we must not stockpile arms beyond our needs or
               seek an excess of military power that could be provocative as well as
               wasteful.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">It is in this spirit that in this fiscal year we are cutting back our
            production of enriched uranium by 25 percent. We are shutting down four
            plutonium piles. We are closing many nonessential military
            installations. And it is in this spirit that we today call on our
            adversaries to do the same.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Third, we must make increased use of our food as an instrument of
            peace--making it available by sale or trade or loan or donation--to
            hungry people in all nations which tell us of their needs and accept
            proper conditions of distribution.</span></p>
      <p>Fourth, we must assure our pre-eminence in the peaceful exploration of
         outer space, focusing on an expedition to the moon in this decade--in
         cooperation with other powers if possible, alone if necessary.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Fifth, we must expand world trade. Having recognized in the Act of 1962
            that we must buy as well as sell, we now expect our trading partners to
            recognize that we must sell as well as buy. We are willing to give them
            competitive access to our market, asking only that they do the same for
            us.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Sixth, we must continue, through such measures as the interest
            equalization tax, as well as the cooperation of other nations, our
            recent progress toward balancing our international accounts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the
            dollar.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Seventh, we must become better neighbors with the free states of the
            Americas, working with the councils of the OAS, with a stronger Alliance
            for Progress, and with all the men and women of this hemisphere who
            really believe in liberty and justice for all.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Eighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to
            develop their independence and raise their standard of living, and
            thereby frustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos. To do this, the
            rich must help the poor--and we must do our part.</span> We must achieve a more
         rigorous administration of our development assistance, with larger roles
         for private investors, for other industrialized nations, and for
         international agencies and for the recipient nations themselves.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Ninth, we must strengthen our Atlantic and Pacific partnerships,
            maintain our alliances and make the United Nations a more effective
            instrument for national independence and international order.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Tenth, and finally, we must develop with our allies new means of
            bridging the gap between the East and the West, facing danger boldly
            wherever danger exists, but being equally bold in our search for new
            agreements which can enlarge the hopes of all, while violating the
            interests of none.</span></p>
      <p>In short, I would say to the Congress that we must be constantly
         prepared for the worst, and constantly acting for the best. <span class="war">We must be
            strong enough to win any war, and we must be wise enough to prevent one.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We shall neither act as aggressors nor tolerate acts of aggression. We
            intend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We can fight, if we must, as we have fought before, but we pray that we
            will never have to fight again.</span> IX.</p>
      <p>My good friends and my fellow Americans: In these last 7 sorrowful
         weeks, we have learned anew that nothing is so enduring as faith, and
         nothing is so degrading as hate.</p>
      <p>John Kennedy was a victim of hate, but he was also a great builder of
         faith--faith in our fellow Americans, whatever their creed or their
         color or their station in life; faith in the future of man, whatever his
         divisions and differences.</p>
      <p>This faith was echoed in all parts of the world. On every continent and
         in every land to which Mrs. Johnson and I traveled, we found faith and
         hope and love toward this land of America and toward our people.</p>
      <p>So I ask you now in the Congress and in the country to join with me in
         expressing and fulfilling that faith in working for a nation, a nation
         that is free from want and a world that is free from hate--a world of
         peace and justice, and freedom and abundance, for our time and for all
         time to come.
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_4,_1965" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>Lyndon B. Johnson</h2>
      <h3>January 4, 1965</h3>
      <p>On this Hill which was my home, I am stirred by old friendships.</p>
      <p>Though total agreement between the Executive and the Congress is
         impossible, total respect is important.</p>
      <p>I am proud to be among my colleagues of the Congress whose legacy to
         their trust is their loyalty to their Nation.</p>
      <p>I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new Members of this body
         tonight.</p>
      <p>Twenty-eight years ago, I felt as you do now. You will soon learn that
         you are among men whose first love is their country, men who try each
         day to do as best they can what they believe is right.</p>
      <p>We are entering the third century of the pursuit of American union.</p>
      <p>Two hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined
         together to demand freedom from arbitrary power.</p>
      <p>For the first century we struggled to hold together the first
         continental union of democracy in the history of man. <span class="war">One hundred years
            ago, in 1865, following a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact
            of union was finally sealed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">For a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and
            interest among the many groups which make up the American community.</span></p>
      <p>That struggle has often brought pain and violence. It is not yet over.
         But we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is
         unmatched in the history of freedom.</p>
      <p>And so tonight, now, in 1965, we begin a new quest for union. We seek
         the unity of man with the world that he has built--with the knowledge
         that can save or destroy him--with the cities which can stimulate or
         stifle him--with the wealth and the machines which can enrich or menace
         his spirit.</p>
      <p>We seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow
         each of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate
         the quality of our civilization. This is the search that we begin
         tonight.</p>
      <p>STATE OF THE WORLD</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in isolation. For
            today the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon the state
            of the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our concern and interest, compassion and vigilance, extend to every
            corner of a dwindling planet.</span></p>
      <p>Yet, it is not merely our concern but the concern of all free men. We
         will not, and we should not, assume that it is the task of Americans
         alone to settle all the conflicts of a torn and troubled world.</p>
      <p>Let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this. For in concert with
         other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom.</p>
      <p>Our first aim remains the safety and the well-being of our own country.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are prepared to live as good neighbors with all, but we cannot be
            indifferent to acts designed to injure our interests, or our citizens,
            or our establishments abroad. The community of nations requires mutual
            respect. We shall extend it--and we shall expect it.</span></p>
      <p>In our relations with the world we shall follow the example of Andrew
         Jackson who said: "I intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right
         and to submit to nothing that is wrong." And he promised, that "the
         honor of my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the
         statement of truth or for the performance of duty." That was this
         Nation's policy in the 1830's and that is this Nation's policy in the
         1960's.</p>
      <p>Our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the
         American dream.</p>
      <p>We were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a
         worldwide desert of disappointed dreams. <span class="civil-rights">Our Nation was created to help
            strike away the chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they
            keep man less than God means him to be.</span></p>
      <p>We are moving toward that destiny, never more rapidly than we have moved
         in the last 4 years.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In this period we have built a military power strong enough to meet any
            threat and destroy any adversary. And that superiority will continue to
            grow so long as this office is mine--and you sit on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
      <p>In this period no new nation has become Communist, and the unity of the
         Communist empire has begun to crumble.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our
            neighbors of the hemisphere, and joined in an Alliance for Progress
            toward economic growth and political democracy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In this period we have taken more steps toward peace--including the test
            ban treaty--than at any time since the cold war began.</span></p>
      <p>In this period we have relentlessly pursued our advances toward the
         conquest of space.</p>
      <p>Most important of all, in this period, the United States has reemerged
         into the fullness of its self-confidence and purpose. No longer are we
         called upon to get America moving. We are moving. No longer do we doubt
         our strength or resolution. We are strong and we have proven our
         resolve.</p>
      <p>No longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical
         decay. We know that history is ours to make. And if there is great
         danger, there is now also the excitement of great expectations.</p>
      <p>AMERICA AND THE COMMUNIST NATIONS</p>
      <p>Yet we still live in a troubled and perilous world. There is no longer a
         single threat. There are many. They differ in intensity and in danger.
         They require different attitudes and different answers.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">With the Soviet Union we seek peaceful understandings that can lessen
            the danger to freedom.</span></p>
      <p>Last fall I asked the American people to choose that course. I will
         carry forward their command.</p>
      <p>If we are to live together in peace, we must come to know each other
         better.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I am sure that the American people would welcome a chance to listen to
            the Soviet leaders on our television--as I would like the Soviet people
            to hear our leaders on theirs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I hope the new Soviet leaders can visit America so they can learn about
            our country at firsthand.</span></p>
      <p>In Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their
         identity. <span class="diplomacy">Your Government, assisted by the leaders in American labor and
            business, is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these
            countries and with the Soviet Union.</span> I will report our conclusions to
         the Congress.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In Asia, communism wears a more aggressive face. We see that in
            Viet-Nam. Why are we there?</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are there, first, because a friendly nation has asked us for help
            against the Communist aggression. Ten years ago our President pledged
            our help. Three Presidents have supported that pledge. We will not break
            it now.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Second, our own security is tied to the peace of Asia. Twice in one
            generation we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East. To
            ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger
            war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Our goal is peace in southeast Asia. That will come only when aggressors
               leave their neighbors in peace.</span></span></p>
      <p>What is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will
         never be found wanting.</p>
      <p>THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD</p>
      <p>But communism is not the only source of trouble and unrest. There are
         older and deeper sources--in the misery of nations and in man's
         irrepressible ambition for liberty and a better life.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">With the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt--and my
            country has always felt--very special ties of interest and affection. It
            will be the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties.
            Together we share and shape the destiny of the new world. In the coming
            year I hope to pay a visit to Latin America. And I will steadily enlarge
            our commitment to the Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war
            against poverty and injustice in this hemisphere.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the Atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 years--a
            Europe that is growing in strength, unity, and cooperation with America.
            A great unfinished task is the reunification of Germany through
            self-determination.</span></p>
      <p>This European policy is not based on any abstract design. It is based on
         the realities of common interests and common values, common dangers and
         common expectations. <span class="diplomacy">These realities will continue to have their
            way--especially, I think, in our expanding trade and especially in our
            common defense.</span></p>
      <p>Free Americans have shaped the policies of the United States. And
         because we know these realities, those policies have been, and will be,
         in the interest of Europe.</p>
      <p>Free Europeans must shape the course of Europe. And, for the same
         reasons, that course has been, and will be, in our interest and in the
         interest of freedom.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the
            last year. I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe
            this year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Africa and Asia we are witnessing the turbulent unfolding of new
            nations and continents.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We welcome them to the society of nations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own
            independence, and to work most closely with those governments dedicated
            to the welfare of all of their people.</span></p>
      <p>We seek not fidelity to an iron faith, but a diversity of belief as
         varied as man himself. <span class="civil-rights">We seek not to extend the power of America but
            the progress of humanity. We seek not to dominate others but to
            strengthen the freedom of all people.</span></p>
      <p>I will seek new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the
         explosion in world population and the growing scarcity in world
         resources.</p>
      <p>Finally, we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the
         effectiveness of the United Nations. The frustrations of the United
         Nations are a product of the world that we live in, and not of the
         institution which gives them voice. It is far better to throw these
         differences open to the assembly of nations than to permit them to
         fester in silent danger.</p>
      <p>These are some of the goals of the American Nation in the world in which
         we live.</p>
      <p>For ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame, neither gratitude nor
         obedience.</p>
      <p>We seek peace.</p>
      <p>We seek freedom.</p>
      <p>We seek to enrich the life of man.</p>
      <p>For that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world
         that we mean for all men to ultimately have.</p>
      <p>TOWARD THE GREAT SOCIETY</p>
      <p>World affairs will continue to call upon our energy and our courage.</p>
      <p>But today we can turn increased attention to the character of American
         life.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We are in the midst of the greatest upward surge of economic well-being
            in the history of any nation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our flourishing progress has been marked by price stability that is
            unequalled in the world. Our balance of payments deficit has declined
            and the soundness of our dollar is unquestioned. I pledge to keep it
            that way and I urge business and labor to cooperate to that end.</span></p>
      <p>We worked for two centuries to climb this peak of prosperity. But we are
         only at the beginning of the road to the Great Society. Ahead now is a
         summit where freedom from the wants of the body can help fulfill the
         needs of the spirit.</p>
      <p>We built this Nation to serve its people.</p>
      <p>We want to grow and build and create, but we want progress to be the
         servant and not the master of man.</p>
      <p>We do not intend to live in the midst of abundance, isolated from
         neighbors and nature, confined by blighted cities and bleak suburbs,
         stunted by a poverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure.</p>
      <p>The Great Society asks not how much, but how good; not only how to
         create wealth but how to use it; not only how fast we are going, but
         where we are headed.</p>
      <p>It proposes as the first test for a nation: the quality of its people.</p>
      <p>This kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swelling riches
         and surging power.</p>
      <p>It will not be the gift of government or the creation of presidents. It
         will require of every American, for many generations, both faith in the
         destination and the fortitude to make the journey.</p>
      <p>And like freedom itself, it will always be challenge and not
         fulfillment. And tonight we accept that challenge.</p>
      <p>A NATIONAL AGENDA</p>
      <p>I propose that we begin a program in education to ensure every American
         child the fullest development of his mind and skills.</p>
      <p>I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing
         diseases.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a
            better and a more stimulating place to live.</span></p>
      <p>I propose that we increase the beauty of America and end the poisoning
         of our rivers and the air that we breathe.</p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="poverty">I propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our
               country that are now suffering from distress and depression.</span></span></p>
      <p>I propose that we make new efforts to control and prevent crime and
         delinquency.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and
            the opportunity to vote.</span></p>
      <p>I propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the
         creations of art.</p>
      <p>I propose that we make an all-out campaign against waste and
         inefficiency.</p>
      <p>THE TASK</p>
      <p>Our basic task is threefold:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, to keep our economy growing;</span></p>
      <p>--to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most
         Americans;</p>
      <p>--and to improve the quality of life for all.</p>
      <p>In the next 6 weeks I will submit special messages with detailed
         proposals for national action in each of these areas.</p>
      <p>Tonight I would like just briefly to explain some of my major
         recommendations in the three main areas of national need.</p>
      <p>1. <span class="economy">A GROWING ECONOMY</span></p>
      <p>BASIC POLICIES</p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, we must keep our Nation prosperous. We seek full employment
            opportunity for every American citizen. I will present a budget designed
            to move the economy forward. More money will be left in the hands of the
            consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes. We will continue along
            the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I confidently predict--what every economic sign tells us tonight--the
            continued flourishing of the American economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">But we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact
            of a recession. The knowledge that our Government will, and can, move
            swiftly will strengthen the confidence of investors and business.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Congress can reinforce this confidence by insuring that its procedures
            permit rapid action on temporary income tax cuts. And special funds for
            job-creating public programs should be made available for immediate use
            if recession threatens.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our continued prosperity demands continued price stability. Business,
            labor, and the consumer all have a high stake in keeping wages and
            prices within the framework of the guideposts that have already served
            the Nation so well.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of
            American business. But we stand ready--with credit and other help--to
            assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire Nation.</span></p>
      <p>ON THE FARMS</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our economy owes much to the efficiency of our farmers. We must continue
            to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward.</span> I have instructed
         the Secretary of Agriculture to lead a major effort to find new
         approaches to reduce the heavy cost of our farm programs and to direct
         more of our effort to the small farmer who needs the help the most.</p>
      <p>INCREASED PROSPERITY</p>
      <p>We can help insure continued prosperity through:</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken
            areas left behind by our national progress;</span></p>
      <p>--further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by
         modern technology, for the laboring-man is an indispensable force in the
         American system;</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--the extension of the minimum wage to more than 2 million unprotected
            workers;</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation
            system.</span></p>
      <p>And as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms, I will propose
         to Congress changes in the Taft-Hartley Act including section 14(b). I
         will do so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have
         divided Americans in various States of our Union.</p>
      <p>In a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to
         continued growth.</p>
      <p>TRANSPORTATION FOR GROWTH</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I will recommend heavier reliance on competition in transportation and a
            new policy for our merchant marine.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I will ask for funds to study high-speed rail transportation between
            urban centers. We will begin with test projects between Washington and
            Boston. On high-speed trains, passengers could travel this distance in
            less than 4 hours.</span></p>
      <p>II. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Second, we must open opportunity to all our people.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Most Americans enjoy a good life. But far too many are still trapped in
            poverty and idleness and fear.</span></p>
      <p>Let a just nation throw open to them the city of promise:</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--to the elderly, by providing hospital care under social security and
            by raising benefit payments to those struggling to maintain the dignity
            of their later years;</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--to the poor and the unfortunate, through doubling the war against
            poverty this year;</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--to Negro Americans, through enforcement of the civil rights law and
            elimination of barriers to the right to vote;</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--to those in other lands that are seeking the promise of America,
            through an immigration law based on the work a man can do and not where
            he was born or how he spells his name.</span></p>
      <p>III. TO ENRICH THE LIFE OF ALL</p>
      <p>Our third goal is to improve the quality of American life.</p>
      <p>THROUGH EDUCATION</p>
      <p>We begin with learning.</p>
      <p>Every child must have the best education that this Nation can provide.</p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson said that no nation can be both ignorant and free.
         Today no nation can be both ignorant and great.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In addition to our existing programs, I will recommend a new program for
            schools and students with a first year authorization of $1,500 million.</span></p>
      <p>It will help at every stage along the road to learning.</p>
      <p>For the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the
         excitement of learning.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">For the primary and secondary school years we will aid public schools
            serving low-income families and assist students in both public and
            private schools.</span></p>
      <p>For the college years we will provide scholarships to high school
         students of the greatest promise and the greatest need and we will
         guarantee low-interest loans to students continuing their college
         studies.</p>
      <p>New laboratories and centers will help our schools--help them lift their
         standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching. These
         centers will provide special training for those who need and those who
         deserve special treatment.</p>
      <p>THROUGH BETTER HEALTH</p>
      <p>Greatness requires not only an educated people but a healthy people.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions
         of our people.</p>
      <p>We already carry on a large program in this country for research and
         health.</p>
      <p>In addition, regional medical centers can provide the most advanced
         diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and
         other major diseases.</p>
      <p>New support for medical and dental education will provide the trained
         people to apply our knowledge.</p>
      <p>Community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for
         school-age children from poor families, including services for the
         mentally retarded.</p>
      <p>THROUGH IMPROVING THE WORLD WE LIVE IN</p>
      <p>The City</p>
      <p>An educated and healthy people require surroundings in harmony with
         their hopes. In our urban areas the central problem today is to protect
         and restore man's satisfaction in belonging to a community where he can
         find security and significance.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">The first step is to break old patterns--to begin to think and work and
            plan for the development of the entire metropolitan areas. We will take
            this step with new programs of help for the basic community facilities
            and for neighborhood centers of health and recreation.</span></p>
      <p>New and existing programs will be open to those cities which work
         together to develop unified long-range policies for metropolitan areas.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">We must also make some very important changes in our housing programs if
            we are to pursue these same basic goals.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">So a Department of Housing and Urban Development will be needed to
            spearhead this effort in our cities.</span></p>
      <p>Every citizen has the right to feel secure in his home and on the
         streets of his community.</p>
      <p>To help control crime, we will recommend programs:</p>
      <p>--to train local law enforcement officers;</p>
      <p>--to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal;</p>
      <p>--to discover the causes of crime and better ways to prevent it.</p>
      <p>I will soon assemble a panel of outstanding experts of this Nation to
         search out answers to the national problem of crime and delinquency, and
         I welcome the recommendations and the constructive efforts of the
         Congress. The Beauty of America</p>
      <p>For over three centuries the beauty of America has sustained our spirit
         and has enlarged our vision. We must act now to protect this heritage.
         In a fruitful new partnership with the States and the cities the next
         decade should be a conservation milestone. We must make a massive effort
         to save the countryside and to establish--as a green legacy for
         tomorrow--more large and small parks, more seashores and open spaces
         than have been created during any other period in our national history.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">A new and substantial effort must be made to landscape highways to
            provide places of relaxation and recreation wherever our roads run,</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets
            and to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation.</span></p>
      <p>We will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water
         before it happens. We will step up our effort to control harmful wastes,
         giving first priority to the cleanup of our most contaminated rivers. We
         will increase research to learn much more about the control of
         pollution.</p>
      <p>We hope to make the Potomac a model of beauty here in the Capital, and
         preserve unspoiled stretches of some of our waterways with a Wild Rivers
         bill.</p>
      <p>More ideas for a beautiful America will emerge from a White House
         Conference on Natural Beauty which I will soon call.</p>
      <p>Art and Science</p>
      <p>We must also recognize and encourage those who can be pathfinders for
         the Nation's imagination and understanding.</p>
      <p>To help promote and honor creative achievements, I will propose a
         National Foundation on the Arts.</p>
      <p>To develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our
         progress, I will recommend programs to encourage basic science,
         particularly in the universities--and to bring closer the day when the
         oceans will supply our growing need for fresh water.</p>
      <p>For government to serve these goals it must be modern in structure,
         efficient in action, and ready for any emergency.</p>
      <p>I am busy, currently, reviewing the structure of the entire executive
         branch of this Government. I hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to
         meet more effectively the tasks of the 20th century.</p>
      <p>Wherever waste is found, I will eliminate it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the
            National Government.</span></p>
      <p>And I intend to do better this year.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">And very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies
            that your Government plans to make.</span></p>
      <p>Even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards.</p>
      <p>I will propose laws to insure the necessary continuity of leadership
         should the President become disabled or die.</p>
      <p>In addition, I will propose reforms in the electoral college--leaving
         undisturbed the vote by States--but making sure that no elector can
         substitute his will for that of the people.</p>
      <p>Last year, in a sad moment, I came here and I spoke to you after 33
         years of public service, practically all of them here on this Hill.</p>
      <p>This year I speak after 1 year as President of the United States.</p>
      <p>Many of you in this Chamber are among my oldest friends. We have shared
         many happy moments and many hours of work, and we have watched many
         Presidents together. Yet, only in the White House can you finally know
         the full weight of this Office.</p>
      <p>The greatest burden is not running the huge operations of government--or
         meeting daily troubles, large and small--or even working with the
         Congress.</p>
      <p>A President's hardest task is not to do what is right, but to know what
         is right.</p>
      <p>Yet the Presidency brings no special gift of prophecy or foresight. You
         take an oath, you step into an office, and you must then help guide a
         great democracy.</p>
      <p>The answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born.</p>
      <p>It was once barren land. The angular hills were covered with scrub cedar
         and a few large live oaks. Little would grow in that harsh caliche soil
         of my country. And each spring the Pedernales River would flood our
         valley.</p>
      <p>But men came and they worked and they endured and they built.</p>
      <p>And tonight that country is abundant; abundant with fruit and cattle and
         goats and sheep, and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods
         are gone.</p>
      <p>Why did men come to that once forbidding land?</p>
      <p>Well, they were restless, of course, and they had to be moving on. But
         there was more than that. There was a dream--a dream of a place where a
         free man could build for himself, and raise his children to a better
         life--a dream of a continent to be conquered, a world to be won, a
         nation to be made.</p>
      <p>Remembering this, I knew the answer.</p>
      <p>A President does not shape a new and personal vision of America.</p>
      <p>He collects it from the scattered hopes of the American past.</p>
      <p>It existed when the first settlers saw the coast of a new world, and
         when the first pioneers moved westward.</p>
      <p>It has guided us every step of the way.</p>
      <p>It sustains every President. But it is also your inheritance and it
         belongs equally to all the people that we all serve.</p>
      <p>It must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs; as I
         have tried, in part, to do tonight.</p>
      <p>It shall lead us as we enter the third century of the search for a more
         perfect union?</p>
      <p>This, then, is the state of the Union: Free and restless, growing and
         full of hope.</p>
      <p>So it was in the beginning.</p>
      <p>So it shall always be, while God is willing, and we are strong enough to
         keep the faith.
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_12,_1966" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>Lyndon B. Johnson</h2>
      <h3>January 12, 1966</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House and the Senate, my
         fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>I come before you tonight to report on the State of the Union for the
         third time.</p>
      <p>I come here to thank you and to add my tribute, once more, to the
         Nation's gratitude for this, the 89th Congress. This Congress has
         already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of
         America.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in
            Vietnam. Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with
            you. It just must be the center of our concerns.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a
            victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people.</span>
         This Nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people
         are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while
         still building a Great Society here at home.</p>
      <p>And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight.</p>
      <p>I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full
         vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law
         last year.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on
            poverty.</span></p>
      <p>I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid
         program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and
         ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and
         to help those nations that are trying to control population growth.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United
            States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never
            before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities
            in America.</span></p>
      <p>I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our
         rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire
         large river basins.</p>
      <p>I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by
         building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal
         system from prevention to probation.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to
            all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal
            and State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to
            obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by
            outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the Federal
            Government by creating a new Cabinet level Department of Transportation
            and reorganizing several existing agencies.</span> In turn, I will restructure
         our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be
         assigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both
         required as well as rewarded.</p>
      <p>I will ask you to make it possible for Members of the House of
         Representatives to work more effectively in the service of the Nation
         through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman
         to 4 years, concurrent with that of the President. II.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would
            like to do.</span> We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. <span class="economy">We will
            make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the
            commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to
            earn it.</span></p>
      <p>We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to
         develop the Great Society.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and
            it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you
            approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit
            will be one of the lowest in many years. It will be only $1.8 billion
            next year. Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8
            billion. Revenues next year will be $111 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">On a cash basis--which is the way that you and I keep our family
            budget--the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus. That
            is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in
            and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government next
            year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in
            the year 1967.</span></p>
      <p>I have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle
         pleasures. I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives
         of the richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people
         who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent
         decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans.</p>
      <p>There are men who cry out: We must sacrifice. Well, let us rather ask
         them: Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children
         who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the
         <span class="poverty">families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home</span>? Will
         they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land,
         the hope of our poor?</p>
      <p>Time may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make
         them.</p>
      <p>But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the
         unfortunate here in a land of plenty.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights"><span class="war">I believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in
               Vietnam.</span> But if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the
            name of justice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in
            the fullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands
            of those that are most in need.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land
            sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight. Hundreds of their servants
            and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber.
            III.</span></p>
      <p>The Great Society leads us along three roads--growth and justice and
         liberation.</p>
      <p>I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves
         already--in every city and countryside. This Nation is flourishing.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Workers are making more money than ever--with after-tax income in the
            past 5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">More people are working than ever before in our history--an increase
            last year of 2 1/2 million jobs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For
            the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last
            year alone they had a rise of 20 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Average farm income is higher than ever. Over the past 5 years it is up
            40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the
            Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of
            payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3
            billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by
            the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working
            with your Government.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this
            balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our
            vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and
            which lowers the savings of every family in this land. It is essential,
            to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise
            price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that
            you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax
            reductions made effective only 12 days ago. Without raising taxes--or
            even increasing the total tax bill paid--we should move to improve our
            withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they
            go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary
            simplifications of the tax structure at an early date.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">I hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of
               Vietnam require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for
               additional appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for
            nondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts--and to
            give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those
            requirements.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try
            those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or
            others exercising their constitutional rights--and to increase penalties
            to a level equal to the nature of the crime.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Legislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the
            Federal Government, to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or
            rental of housing.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">For that other nation within a Nation--the poor--whose distress has now
            captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to
            continue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will
            provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of
            experience.</span></p>
      <p>To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we
         will plan for the future through the establishment of several new
         Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of
         Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and
         adequate and available medical resources.</p>
      <p>For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to
         expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14(b) of the
         Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the
         laws of the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures.</p>
      <p>And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which,
         without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us
         effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to
         the national interest.</p>
      <p>Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge
         that shared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern
         man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of
         his life, and which individual abundance alone will not overcome.</p>
      <p>We can subdue and we can master these forces--bring increased meaning to
         our lives--if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to
         change old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream
         is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great
         people.</p>
      <p>This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.</p>
      <p>Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of
         last year, <span class="war">extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives
            in our Armed Forces.</span></p>
      <p>I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs
         already passed by the Senate--the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and
         home rule for the District of Columbia.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and
            neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people.
            Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward
            with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all
            the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people
            can come to live the good life.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the
            growth of entire metropolitan areas.</span></p>
      <p>Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is
         really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our
         air.</p>
      <p>We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river
         basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and
         construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire
         river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for
         all of our people.</p>
      <p>To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must
         have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local
         police forces.</p>
      <p>Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their
         streets--and that right just must be secured.</p>
      <p>Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our
         highways.</p>
      <p>I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this
         mounting tragedy.</p>
      <p>We must also act to prevent the deception of the American
         consumer--requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their
         contents--all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed--and
         keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.</p>
      <p>It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring
         institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich
         fertility of American political invention. We must change to master
         change.</p>
      <p>I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive
         branch, to modernize the relations between city and State and Nation.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">A new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our
            transportation activities. The present structure--35 Government
            agencies, spending $5 billion yearly--makes it almost impossible to
            serve either the growing demands of this great Nation or the needs of
            the industry, or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real
            frugality.</span></p>
      <p>I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a
         new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of
         sound--in excess of 2,000 miles per hour.</p>
      <p>I propose to examine our Federal system--the relation between city,
         State, Nation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the
         most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I
         will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use
         the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the
         problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people.</p>
      <p>As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must
         make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life
         without being obligated to a few large contributors.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic
         restriction on contributions--to prohibit the endless proliferation of
         committees, bringing local and State committees under the act--to attach
         strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure
         of contributions--and to broaden the participation of the people,
         through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the
         party and to the candidate of their choice.</p>
      <p>To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to
         provide a 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives--which
         should not begin before 1972.</p>
      <p>The present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert
         enormous energies to an almost constant process of
         campaigning--depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their
         skill and their wisdom. Today, too, the work of government is far more
         complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more
         time to master the technical tasks of legislating. And a longer term
         will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life.
         The Nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional
         district, will all be better served by a 4-year term for Members of the
         House. And I urge your swift action. IV.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Tonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam. That conflict is not an
            isolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have
            followed with strong consistency since World War II.</span></p>
      <p>The touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States--the
         welfare and the freedom of the people of the United States. But nations
         sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass.</p>
      <p>In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims
         could bring decay and even disaster.</p>
      <p>An America that is mighty beyond description--yet living in a hostile or
         despairing world--would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization
         to liberate the spirit of man.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to
            Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have
               extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the
               largest program of economic assistance in the world.</span></span></p>
      <p>And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of
         social justice.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression--in Korea
            under President Truman--in the Formosa Straits under President
            Eisenhower--in Cuba under President Kennedy--and again in Vietnam.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention,</span> but across the
         world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will
         discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five
         continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four
         Presidents.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are
               estimated to increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other
               expenditures put together in the entire Federal budget will rise this
               coming year by only $.6 billion. This is true because of the stringent
               cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department,
               and followed by the other departments of Government.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We will vigorously pursue existing proposals--and seek new ones--to
            control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.</span></p>
      <p>By strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by
         meeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing
         world.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for
            Progress, the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the
            regional organizations of developing continents, and that supreme
            association--the United Nations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">We will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to
               trade, and to improve international finance.</span></span></p>
      <p>From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has
         rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only
         a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands.</p>
      <p>This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign
         assistance to help those countries who will help themselves.</p>
      <p>We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease
         and ignorance.</p>
      <p>We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great
         America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those
         countries committed to develop a modern agriculture.</p>
      <p>We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give
         children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to
         give our own children. To advance these ends I will propose the
         International Education Act of 1966.</p>
      <p>I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at
         disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the
         uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out
         smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world
         during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population
         growth, by increasing our research--and we will earmark funds to help
         their efforts.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate
            $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to
            join us in this work in the world.</span></p>
      <p>For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks
         the way that it has chosen to walk for itself.</p>
      <p>We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule.</p>
      <p>We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued
         hostility to the rule of the many by the few--or the oppression of one
         race by another.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe. And I
            will ask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff
            restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East
            and the West.</span></p>
      <p>The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force
         of today's world in which we live.</p>
      <p>In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of
         those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will.</p>
      <p>It is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire.</p>
      <p>In recent months a number of nations have east out those who would
         subject them to the ambitions of mainland China.</p>
      <p>History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped
         from the genius of each people. History does not favor a single system
         or belief--unless force is used to make it so.</p>
      <p><span class="war">That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle
            of our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba--and tonight in
            Vietnam.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and
            young Americans die in a distant land.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Tonight, as so many nights before, the American Nation is asked to
            sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the
            love of its freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">How many times--in my lifetime and in yours--have the American people
            gathered, as they do now, to hear their President tell them of conflict
            and tell them of danger?</span></p>
      <p>Each time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort
         that the security and the freedom of this Nation required.</p>
      <p><span class="war">And they do again tonight in Vietnam.</span> Not too many years ago Vietnam was
         a peaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent Communist
         government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the
         friendly help of the United States.</p>
      <p><span class="war">There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on
            their own people. But their progress was slight. Their hope of success
            was dim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on
            conquest. And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved
            from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants
            of revolution in aggression.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could
            leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain
            conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam.
            We stayed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And we will stay until aggression has stopped.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its
            enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on
            America's solemn pledge--a pledge which has grown through the
            commitments of three American Presidents.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose
               independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word
               and in America's protection. To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken
               that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and
               would whet the appetite of aggression. We would have to fight in one
               land, and then we would have to fight in another--or abandon much of
               Asia to the domination of Communists.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Last year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again. Swiftly
            increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to
            join forces that were already in the South. Attack and terror increased,
            spurred and encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the
            will to continue and that their victory was near.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Despite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold
            back the mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the
            South, and to make our firmness clear to the North. Thus. we began
            limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam. We
            increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000
            men.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its
            success. The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill
            and the bravery of Americans and their allies--and by the enduring
            courage of the South Vietnamese who, I can tell you, have lost eight men
            last year for every one of ours.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side.
            There is no cause to doubt the American commitment.</span></p>
      <p>Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam, with
            friends and adversaries throughout the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Since Christmas your Government has labored again, with imagination and
               endurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement. For 20 days now
               we and our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more
            than 40 countries. We have talked to more than a hundred governments,
            all 113 that we have relations with, and some that we don't. We have
            talked to the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members
            to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and
            to friends, in Rome and Warsaw, in Paris and Tokyo, in Africa and
            throughout this hemisphere, America has made her position abundantly
            clear.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We seek neither territory nor bases, <span class="economy">economic domination</span> or military
            alliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of
            self-determination--that the people of South Vietnam should be able to
            choose their own course, choose it in free elections without violence,
            without terror, and without fear.</span></p>
      <p>The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great
         question of reunification.</p>
      <p>This is all we want for South Vietnam. It is all the people of South
         Vietnam want. And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires
         less than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard.</p>
      <p>We have also made it clear--from Hanoi to New York--that there are no
         arbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva
         Agreements of 1954 and 1962. <span class="diplomacy">We will meet at any conference table, we
            will discuss any proposals--four points or fourteen or forty--and we
            will consider the views of any group. <span class="war">We will work for a cease-fire now
               or once discussions have begun. We will respond if others reduce their
               use of force, and we will withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is
               securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future.</span></span></p>
      <p>We have said all this, and we have asked--and hoped--and we have waited
         for a response.</p>
      <p>So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because
            we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied
            to our own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have found understanding and support. And we know they wait with us
            tonight for some response that could lead to peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this
               conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future
               may require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard
               conference, or even both at once.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will
            act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of
            South Vietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither
            increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">But we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and
               every dollar, and every decision--whatever the cost or whatever the
               challenge.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those
            that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry
            forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain
            terrors of war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the
            months may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands
            us to battle.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far
            that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an
            immense design to subdue history to their will. But for others it must
            now be clear--the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies
            between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only
            lose.</span></p>
      <p>The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared
         needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education--the chance
         to build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of
         battle--the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own
         destiny. <span class="war">For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent
            peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">It is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will,
            and so many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again
            tonight:</span> <span class="diplomacy">Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace,
            and beyond that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and
            life is the servant of life.</span></p>
      <p>In this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve.
         V.</p>
      <p>This is the State of the Union.</p>
      <p><span class="war">But over it all--wealth, and promise, and expectation--lies our
            troubling awareness of American men at war tonight.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">How many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other
            wars? How very many are not here to listen?</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The war in Vietnam is not like these other wars. Yet, finally, war is
            always the same. It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise.
            It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to
            hate.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this
            world.</span></p>
      <p>Many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me. But
         there is a difference. <span class="war">For finally I must be the one to order our guns
            to fire, against all the most inward pulls of my desire.</span> For we have
         children to teach, and we have sick to be cured, <span class="civil-rights">and we have men to be
            freed.</span> <span class="poverty">There are poor to be lifted up,</span> <span class="infra">and there are cities to be built,</span>
         and there is a world to be helped.</p>
      <p>Yet we do what we must.</p>
      <p>I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got,
         to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires.</p>
      <p>Yet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the
         clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see
         the promise of two centuries tremble. I believe tonight that you do not
         want me to try that risk. And from that belief your President summons
         his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come.</p>
      <p>The work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with
         whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with
         our mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth.</p>
      <p>Thank you, and goodnight.

      <h3>January 10, 1967</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished Members of the Congress:</p>
      <p>I share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of
         one of the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body,
         the distinguished Representative from Rhode Island, Mr. Fogarty.</p>
      <p>I have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing
         for our Nation.</p>
      <p>At home, the question is whether we will continue working for better
         opportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living
         better than any people in history.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Abroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a
            very costly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is
            seemingly remote.</span></p>
      <p>So our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the
         dangers to us are obvious and dose at hand, but, rather, whether we
         carry on when they seem obscure and distant--and some think that it is
         safe to lay down our burdens.</p>
      <p>I have come tonight to ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that
         issue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad--to continue to build
         a better America--and to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.</p>
      <p>As President Abraham Lincoln said, "We must ask where we are, and
         whither we are tending." I.</p>
      <p>The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better
         country.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We have struck down legal barriers to equality.</span></p>
      <p>We have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this
         year alone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.</p>
      <p>We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford
         it. Three and one-half million Americans have already received treatment
         under Medicare since July.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more
            Americans on the payrolls in the last year alone.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum
            wage.</span></p>
      <p>We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost
         1 million Americans.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty
            in the neighborhoods of the poor.</span> <span class="infra">We have set out to rebuild our cities
            on a scale that has never been attempted before.</span> We have begun to rescue
         our waters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our
         land and our countryside, our cities and our towns.</p>
      <p>We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the
         Neighborhood Youth Corps--or through Head Start, a chance to learn.</p>
      <p>So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people. And, we have
         succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few. Now
         we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further
         progress, or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have
         been--abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great
         work through.</p>
      <p>I believe that our people do not want to quit--though the task is great,
         the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or
         months, but of years--and sometimes it may be even decades. II.</p>
      <p>I have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying
         forward the progress of these last 3 years. These five ways concern
         programs, partnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace.</p>
      <p>First, programs. We must see to it, I think, that these new programs
         that we have passed work effectively and are administered in the best
         possible way.</p>
      <p>Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social
         progress. This required trial and error--and it has produced both. But
         as we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy
         and we are trying to improve our tactics. In the long run, these
         starts--some rewarding, others inadequate and disappointing--are crucial
         to SUCCESS.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">One example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate
            among us.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">On a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American
            President, Harry S. Truman, declare this: "The American people have
            decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as
            preventable disease."</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few
            understood what was required and did anything about it. The executive
            branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any
            action on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great
            President presented. And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress
            joined with me in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, "It
            will not be a short or easy struggle--no single weapon... will
            suffice--but we shall not rest until that war is won."</span></p>
      <p>And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to
            enjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.</span></p>
      <p>I shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the
         Congress--as well as some that we have learned from our own trial and
         error.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of
            thousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big
            cities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young,
            little children. The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must
            command our full determination. For learning brings skills; and skills
            bring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, <span class="economy">as well as taxes.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">This war--<span class="war">like the war in Vietnam</span>--is not a simple one. There is no
            single battle-line which you can plot each day on a chart. The enemy is
            not easy to perceive, or to isolate, or to destroy. There are mistakes
            and there are setbacks. But we are moving, and our direction is forward</span>.</p>
      <p>This is true with other programs that are making and breaking new
         ground. Some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all
         the money that could be put into them. Administrative skills and trained
         manpower are just as vital to their success as dollars. And I believe
         those skills will come. But it will take time and patience and hard
         work. Success cannot be forced at a single stroke. So we must continue
         to strengthen the administration of every program if that success is to
         come--as we know it must.</p>
      <p>We have done much in the space of 2 short years, working together.</p>
      <p>I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different
         reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this
         Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.</p>
      <p>I have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department--a
         Department of Business and Labor.</p>
      <p>By combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and
         other related agencies, I think we can create a more economical,
         efficient, and streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing
         nation.</p>
      <p>This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government. Every program
         will be thoroughly evaluated. <span class="economy">Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and
            simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our
            Governors.</span></p>
      <p>Where there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them.</p>
      <p>Where there has been progress, we will try to build upon it.</p>
      <p>Our second objective is partnership--to create an effective partnership
         at all levels of government. And I should treasure nothing more than to
         have that partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The 88th and the 89th Congresses passed more social and economic
            legislation than any two single Congresses in American history.</span> Most of
         you who were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those
         measures. But your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the
         people.</p>
      <p>Federal energy is essential. But it is not enough. Only a total working
         partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed. The
         test of that partnership will be the concern of each public
         organization, each private institution, and each responsible citizen.</p>
      <p>Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for
         government in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive
         department, and as I see you are examining yours. Some will need to
         reorganize and reshape their methods of administration--as we are doing.
         Others will need to revise their constitutions and their laws to bring
         them up to date--as we are doing. Above all, I think we must work
         together and find ways in which the multitudes of small jurisdictions
         can be brought together more efficiently.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments
            about $40 billion in grants-in-aid. This year alone, 70 percent of our
            Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through
            the State and local governments. With Federal assistance, State and
            local governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion
            annually. These enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and
            effectively. We intend to work closely with the States and the
            localities to do exactly that.</span></p>
      <p>Our third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that
         we have established within the resources that are available.</p>
      <p>I wish, of course, that we could do all that should be done--and that we
         could do it now. But the Nation has many commitments and
         responsibilities which make heavy demands upon our total resources. No
         administration would more eagerly utilize for these programs all the
         resources they require than the administration that started them.</p>
      <p>So let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we
         have--knowing that it is far, far more than we have ever done before,
         and far, far less than our problems will ultimately require.</p>
      <p>Let us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans
         who need special help.</p>
      <p>We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3
         years old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in
         the early years.</p>
      <p>We should try new methods of child development and care from the
         earliest years, before it is too late to correct.</p>
      <p>And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.</p>
      <p>Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in
         their Nation's progress.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20
            percent. That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security
            payments in the first year. I will recommend that each of the 23 million
            Americans now receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percent--from $44
            to $70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for
            those with a total of 25 years of coverage. We must raise the limits
            that retired workers can earn without losing social security income.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of
            age.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to
            the forgotten in our midst--the American Indians and the migratory farm
            workers. <span class="poverty">And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help
               those who live in rural poverty.</span></span></p>
      <p>And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.</p>
      <p>So let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the
         meaning of justice for all of our fellow Americans.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="infra">We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through
               the landmark Model Cities program. I intend to seek for this effort,
               this year, the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.</span></span></p>
      <p>We should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced
         technology to help rebuild our great cities.</p>
      <p>We should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on
         pollution at its sources, and--because air, like water, does not respect
         manmade boundaries--we should set up "regional airsheds" throughout this
         great land.</p>
      <p>We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign
         for a beautiful America--to dean up our towns, to make them more
         beautiful, our cities, our countryside, <span class="infra">by creating more parks, and more
            seashores, and more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the
            generations that come after us to enjoy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen--before
            a jury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights. We should find
            a solution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color,
            has a decent home of his choice.</span></p>
      <p>We should modernize our Selective Service System. The National
         Commission on Selective Service will shortly submit its report. I will
         send you new recommendations to meet our military manpower needs. But
         let us resolve that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws
         as fair and as effective as possible.</p>
      <p>We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the "right most valued by
         civilized men"--the right to privacy. We should outlaw all
         wiretapping--public and private--wherever and whenever it occurs, except
         when the security of this Nation itself is at stake--and only then with
         the strictest governmental safeguards. And we should exercise the full
         reach of our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic "bugging" and
         "snooping."</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer. We
            should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed
            where average citizens can understand it.</span> We should immediately take
         steps to prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against
         hazardous household products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that
         carry natural gas across our Nation.</p>
      <p>We should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000
         permanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age.</p>
      <p>We should improve the process of democracy by passing our election
         reform and financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating
         lobbying, and by restoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move
         their residences.</p>
      <p>We should develop educational television into a vital public resource to
         enrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our
         classrooms. We should insist that the public interest be fully served
         through the public's airwaves.</p>
      <p>And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.</p>
      <p>Now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our minds--on
         yours and mine. This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.</p>
      <p>The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing
         the Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended. We appointed the
         National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the
         best ways to carry that attack forward.</p>
      <p>And while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its
         preliminary recommendations we are ready to move.</p>
      <p>This is not a war that Washington alone can win. The idea of a national
         police force is repugnant to the American people. Crime must be rooted
         out in local communities by local authorities. Our policemen must be
         better trained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the
         local citizens that they try to serve and to protect.</p>
      <p>The National Government can and expects to help.</p>
      <p>And so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime
         Control Act of 1967. It will enable us to assist those States and cities
         that try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces
         better, their corrections systems more effective, and their courts more
         efficient.</p>
      <p>When the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to
         provide a substantial percentage of the cost:</p>
      <p>--90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master
         plans, to combat crime in their area;</p>
      <p>--60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing
         instant communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the
         latest equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the
         war on crime;</p>
      <p>--50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police
         academy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best
         trained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere. We
         will also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from
         becoming adult delinquents. We will seek new partnerships with States
         and cities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem. And we
         will recommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.</p>
      <p>At the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free
         America--as Abraham Lincoln once said--must "let reverence for the laws
         . . . become the political religion of the Nation."</p>
      <p>Our country's laws must be respected. Order must be maintained. And I
         will support--with all the constitutional powers the President
         possesses--our Nation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to
         control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our
         communities.</p>
      <p>Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have
         already been laid. Some will necessarily be small at first, but "every
         beginning is a consequence." If we postpone this urgent work now, it
         will simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher
         price.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead,
            moving ahead steadily and safely.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity.
            Last year, in 1966:</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--Wages were the highest in history--and the unemployment rate,
            announced yesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--Our gross national product advanced 5.5 percent, to about $740
            billion;</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--Income per farm went up 6 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">Now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.5
               percent over the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam.</span>
            This was more than we had expected--and the Government tried to do
            everything that we knew how to do to hold it down. Yet we were not as
            successful as we wished to be. <span class="war">In the 18 months after we entered World
               War II, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 13.5 percent. In the first 18
               months after Korea, after the conflict broke out there, prices rose not
               4.5 percent, but 11 percent.</span> During those two periods we had OPA price
            control that the Congress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to
               avoid imposing them. We believe that we have done better, but we make no
               pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive
            rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit. They imposed very
            severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home
            builders, and all those associated with the home industry.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and
            moderate tax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic
            expansion. Legislatively and administratively we took several billions
            out of the economy. With these measures, in both instances, the Congress
            approved most of the recommendations rather promptly.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored. Wholesale
            prices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food
            prices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have
            retreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be
            available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so
            earnestly seek, I am confident that this movement can continue. I pledge
            the American people that I will do everything in a President's power to
            lower interest rates and to ease money in this country. The Federal Home
            Loan Bank Board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make
            immediately available to savings and loan associations an additional $1
            billion, and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest
            rate charged on those loans.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy
            that we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary
            spirals; <span class="war">that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam
               and the progress of our people at home;</span> that will support a significant
            improvement in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier
            credit and toward lower interest rates.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate
            and individual income taxes--to last for 2 years or for so long as the
            unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue. I
            will promptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in
            these expenditures permits it. This surcharge will raise revenues by
            some $4.5 billion in the first year. For example, a person whose tax
            payment, the tax he owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an
            extra $60 over the 12-month period, or $5 a month. The overwhelming
            majority of Americans who pay taxes today are below that figure and they
            will pay substantially less than $5 a month. Married couples with two
            children, with incomes up to $5,000 per year, will be exempt from this
            tax--as will single people with an income of up to $1,900 a year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in
            effect when I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual
            taxes would have been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates.
            So this proposal is that while we have this problem and this emergency
            in Vietnam, while we are trying to meet the needs of our people at home,
            your Government asks for slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut
            each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968
            within prudent limits and to give our country and to give our fighting
            men the help they need in this hour of trial.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">For fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.7
            billion and revenues of $117 billion. That will leave us a deficit this
            year of $9.7 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion. And
            with the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we
            estimate revenues will be $126.9 billion. The deficit then will be $8.1
            billion.</span></p>
      <p>I will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress.
         Yours is the responsibility to discuss and to debate them--to approve or
         modify or reject them.</p>
      <p>I welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years
         as a colleague and as Vice President and President.</p>
      <p>I should like to say to the Members of the opposition--whose numbers, if
         I am not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhat--that the genius of
         the American political system has always been best expressed through
         creative debate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives.
         Throughout our history, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to
         understand this. So let there be light and reason in our relations. That
         is the way to a responsible session and a responsive government.</p>
      <p>Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve
         the quality of life for every American--not just the rich, not just the
         poor, but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.</p>
      <p>We all go to school--to good schools or bad schools. We all take air
         into our lungs--clean air or polluted air. We all drink water--pure
         water or polluted water. We all face sickness someday, and some more
         often than we wish, and old age as well. We all have a stake in this
         Great Society--<span class="economy">in its economic growth,</span> <span class="civil-rights">in reduction of civil strife</span>--a
         great stake in good government.</p>
      <p>We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this
         country in these years. Our children's children will pay the price if we
         are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to
         stand up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time
         allotted us. III.</p>
      <p>Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change. But abroad, as at
         home, there is a greater risk in standing still. No part of our foreign
         policy is so sacred that it ever remains beyond review. We shall be
         flexible where conditions in the world change--and where man's efforts
         can change them for the better.</p>
      <p>We are in the midst of a great transition--a transition from narrow
         nationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the
         cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a
         threatened planet.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very
            shortly to give our hemispheric policies new direction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American
            effort in economic and social development was launched by the conference
            at Bogota in 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower. The
            Alliance for Progress moved dramatically forward under President
            Kennedy. There is new confidence that the voice of the people is being
            heard; that the dignity of the individual is stronger than ever in this
            hemisphere, and we are facing up to and meeting many of the hemispheric
            problems together. In this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be
            made to happen--because it has happened. So together, I think, we must
            now move to strike down the barriers to full cooperation among the
            American nations, and to free the energies and the resources of two
            great continents on behalf of all of our citizens.</span></p>
      <p>Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America. It
         has yet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and,
         above all, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible.
         There, too, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of
         <span class="diplomacy">Africa cooperate on a regional basis. More and more our programs for
            Africa are going to be directed toward self-help.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="civil-rights">The future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts. Our
               policy will continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to
               support those who are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony
               between races, and to help those who demand change but reject the fool's
               gold of violence.</span></span></p>
      <p>In the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately,
         has not yet taken hold. An already tortured peace seems to be constantly
         threatened. We shall try to use our influence to increase the
         possibilities of improved relations among the nations of that region. We
         are working hard at that task.</p>
      <p>In the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the
         earth's population. <span class="economy">Over the years we--and others--have invested very
            heavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and
            Pakistan</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict.</span>
         It must strengthen their capacity to help themselves. It must help these
         two nations--both our friends--to overcome poverty, to emerge as
         self-reliant leaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common
            defense. But we also look forward to the time when greater security can
            be achieved through measures of arms control and disarmament, and
            through other forms of practical agreement.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs,</span>
         <span class="economy">in economic and technical cooperation,</span> <span class="diplomacy">in trade negotiations, in
            political consultation, and in working together with the governments and
            peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p>The emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve
         when we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel
         and try to help rebuild Europe. We faced new challenges and
         opportunities then and there--and we faced also some dangers. But I
         believe that the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both
         sides of this Chamber, wanted to face them together.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in
            transition. We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold
            war. When we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for
            that matter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and
            without venom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses
            of outer space.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial
            credits to Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to
            Romania and Yugoslavia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for
            another 2 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to
            embassies.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have started discussions with international agencies on ways of
            increasing contacts with Eastern European countries.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to
            fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the
            world that were entered into before I became President.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">So tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our
            commercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by
            approving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile
            capabilities. It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile
            defense. My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no
            nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use
            its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our allies.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and
            the United States is in our common interest, in arms control and in
            disarmament. We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between
            us, if that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons
            and defenses. I thought we were making some progress in that direction
            the first few months I was in office. I realize that any additional race
            would impose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an
            additional waste of resources with no gain in security to either side.</span></p>
      <p>I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the
         Congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing
         directly upon this problem.</p>
      <p>Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human
         family is the race between food supply and population increase. That
         race tonight is being lost.</p>
      <p>The time for rhetoric has clearly passed. The time for concerted action
         is here and we must get on with the job.</p>
      <p>We believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to
         succeed:</p>
      <p>First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food
         production, including the use of technology and the capital of private
         enterprise.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into
            voluntary family planning programs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">And third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid
            starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to
            feed themselves.</span></p>
      <p>Every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to
         help bring our most basic human account into balance. IV.</p>
      <p><span class="war">I come now finally to Southeast Asia--and to Vietnam in particular. Soon
            I will submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation.
            Tonight I want to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies
            are committed by the SEATO Treaty to "act to meet the common danger" of
            aggression in Southeast Asia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the
            United States, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically
            violated by the Communists. That violation threatens the independence of
            all the small nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the
            entire region and perhaps the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to
            remain non-Communist--if that is what they choose--as North Vietnam has
            to remain Communist.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all
            necessary measures to prevent further aggression.</span></p>
      <p>No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken
         by the great Thomas Jefferson:</p>
      <p>"It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes
         to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater."</p>
      <p><span class="war">We have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to
            prevent a larger war--a war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the
            Communists succeed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by
            aggression and by force. I believe, and I am supported by some
            authority, that if they are not checked now the world can expect to pay
            a greater price to check them later.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">That is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that
            is why it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">You will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago. Is there
            anyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was
            not changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression--this
            time it was in Korea. Imagine how different Asia might be today if we
            had failed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south.
            The Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in
            Vietnam, as we said 16 years ago in Korea: "This far and no further."</span></p>
      <p>I think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a
         stubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to
         settle political questions.</p>
      <p><span class="war">I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over. This I
            cannot do. We face more cost, more loss, and more agony. For the end is
            not yet. I cannot promise you that it will come this year--or come next
            year. Our adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on
            fighting longer than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be
            prepared to stand up and resist.</span></p>
      <p>O<span class="war">ur men in that area--there are nearly 500,000 now--have borne well "the
            burden and the heat of the day." Their efforts have deprived the
            Communist enemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a
            year ago. We have steadily frustrated his main forces. General
            Westmoreland reports that the enemy can no longer succeed on the
            battlefield.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustained--and will be
            sustained--until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more
            than he can ever gain.</span></p>
      <p>I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy
         of "accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material
         resource"--of "laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their
         trade." That, and patience--and I mean a great deal of patience.</p>
      <p>Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight. Because they
         must provide real security to the people living in the countryside. <span class="war">And
            this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped
            and killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they
            can be successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security
            forces.</span> It means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian
         government that they can respect, and that they can rely upon and that
         they can participate in, and that they can have a personal stake in. We
         hope that government is now beginning to emerge.</p>
      <p><span class="war">While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort,
            the very distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports
            that South Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency.
            We can help, but only they can win this part of the war. Their task is
            to build and protect a new life in each rural province.</span></p>
      <p>One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.</p>
      <p>It is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence
         is not going to be slammed shut. They know that it is possible for them
         to choose their own national destinies--without coercion.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The performance of our men in Vietnam--backed by the American
            people--has created a feeling of confidence and unity among the
            independent nations of Asia and the Pacific.</span> I saw it in their faces in
         the 19 days that I spent in their homes and in their countries. Fear of
         external Communist conquest in many Asian nations is already
         subsiding--and with this, the spirit of hope is rising. For the first
         time in history, a common outlook and common institutions are already
         emerging.</p>
      <p>This forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of
         Asian nations themselves. It was precisely this movement that we hoped
         to accelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965,
         and I pledged "a much more massive effort to improve the life of man" in
         that part of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds
         that we were spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and
         production.</p>
      <p>Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors
         of the billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the
         Congress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you
         are already open. Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a
         dozen new directions. Their hopes are high. Their faith is strong. Their
         confidence is deep.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying
            forward this constructive historic development. As recommended by the
            Eugene Black mission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a
            special authorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian
            regional programs.</span></p>
      <p>We are eager to turn our resources to peace. Our efforts in behalf of
         humanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any
         boundary line. The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I
         will ask the Congress for funds to join in an international program of
         reconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam--and their
         deserving neighbors who wish our help.</p>
      <p>We shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of
         Mainland China and the world community--including working together in
         all the tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate
         of the Chinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her
            neighbors' rights. We would be the first to applaud her were she to
            apply her great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of
            her people. And we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate
            needs for security and friendly relations with her neighboring
            countries.</span></p>
      <p>Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction
         that we, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see
         Vietnam through to an honorable peace.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and
            others, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional
            discussions of peace--anywhere, any time. And we will continue to take
            every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Until such efforts succeed,</span> <span class="war">or until the infiltration ceases, or until
            the conflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is
            that we just must firmly pursue our present course. We will stand firm
            in Vietnam.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest
            burden of all. With their lives they serve their Nation. We must give
            them nothing less than our full support--and we have given them
            that--nothing less than the determination that Americans have always
            given their fighting men. Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is
            more than $5 a month, it is small compared to their own.</span></p>
      <p>How long it will take I cannot prophesy. I only know that the will of
         the American people, I think, is tonight being tested.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time,
            and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other
            than ourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the
            temptation to "get it over with" is inviting but dangerous; whether we
            can accept the necessity of choosing "a great evil in order to ward off
            a greater"; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the
            passions that are ordinarily loosed in time of war--on all these
            questions so much turns.</span></p>
      <p>The answers will determine not only where we are, but "whither we are
         tending."</p>
      <p>A time of testing--yes. And a time of transition. The transition is
         sometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and
         often quite dangerous.</p>
      <p>But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live
         with it for a long time yet to come. We know that "man is born unto
         trouble." We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not
         survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a
         great many men.</p>
      <p>For all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations
         that concern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to
         resolve, for all the issues we must face with the agony that attends
         them, let us remember that "those who expect to reap the blessings of
         freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it."</p>
      <p>But let us also count not only our burdens but our blessings--for they
         are many.</p>
      <p>And let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.</p>
      <p>Let us draw encouragement from the signs of hope--for they, too, are
         many.</p>
      <p>Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never
         been found wanting.</p>
      <p>So with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your
         support, we are going to persist--and we are going to succeed.

      <h3>January 17, 1968</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress, and my fellow
         Americans:</p>
      <p>I was thinking as I was walking down the aisle tonight of what Sam
         Rayburn told me many years ago: The Congress always extends a very warm
         welcome to the President--as he comes in.</p>
      <p>Thank all of you very, very much.</p>
      <p>I have come once again to this Chamber--the home of our democracy--to
         give you, as the Constitution requires, "Information of the State of the
         Union."</p>
      <p>I report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad:</p>
      <p>--that it is our will that is being tried, not our strength; our sense
         of purpose, not our ability to achieve a better America;</p>
      <p>--that we have the strength to meet our every challenge; the physical
         strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home; and the
         moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world.</p>
      <p>And I report to you that I believe, with abiding conviction, that this
         people--nurtured by their deep faith, tutored by their hard lessons,
         moved by their high aspirations--have the will to meet the trials that
         these times impose.</p>
      <p>Since I reported to you last January:</p>
      <p><span class="war">--Three elections have been held in Vietnam--in the midst of war and
            under the constant threat of violence.</span></p>
      <p>--A President, a Vice President, a House and Senate, and village
         officials have been chosen by popular, contested ballot.</p>
      <p><span class="war">--The enemy has been defeated in battle after battle.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--The number of South Vietnamese living in areas under Government
            protection tonight has grown by more than a million since January of
            last year.</span></p>
      <p>These are all marks of progress. Yet:</p>
      <p><span class="war">--The enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into
            battle, despite his continuous heavy losses.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">--He continues to hope that America's will to persevere can be broken.
            Well--he is wrong. America will persevere. Our patience and our
            perseverance will match our power. Aggression will never prevail.</span></p>
      <p>But our goal is peace--and peace at the earliest possible moment.</p>
      <p>Right now we are exploring the meaning of Hanoi's recent statement.
         <span class="war">There is no mystery about the questions which must be answered before
            the bombing is stopped.</span></p>
      <p>We believe that any talks should follow the San Antonio formula that I
         stated last September, which said:</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--The bombing would stop immediately if talks would take place promptly
            and with reasonable hopes that they would be productive.</span></p>
      <p>--And the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they
         have in the past. This Nation simply cannot accept anything less without
         jeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">If a basis for peace talks can be established on the San Antonio
            foundations--and it is my hope and my prayer that they can--we would
            consult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete
            cessation of hostilities--a really true cease-fire--could be made the
            first order of business.</span> I will report at the earliest possible moment
         the results of these explorations to the American people.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">I have just recently returned from a very fruitful visit and talks with
               His Holiness the Pope and I share his hope--as he expressed it earlier
               today--that both sides will extend themselves in an effort to bring an
               end to the war in Vietnam. I have today assured him that we and our
               allies will do our full part to bring this about.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Since I spoke to you last January, other events have occurred that have
            major consequences for world peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--The Kennedy Round achieved the greatest reduction in tariff barriers
            in all the history of trade negotiations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--The nations of Latin America at Punta del Este resolved to move toward
            economic integration.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">--In Asia, the nations from Korea and Japan to Indonesia and Singapore
               worked behind America's shield to strengthen their economies and to
               broaden their political cooperation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--In Africa, from which the distinguished Vice President has just
            returned, he reports to me that there is a spirit of regional
            cooperation that is beginning to take hold in very practical ways.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">These events we all welcomed. Yet since I last reported to you, we and
            the world have been confronted by a number of crises:</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">--During the Arab-Israeli war last June, the hot line between Washington
               and Moscow was used for the first time in our history. A cease-fire was
               achieved without a major power confrontation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Now the nations of the Middle East have the opportunity to cooperate
            with Ambassador Jarring's U.N. mission and they have the responsibility
            to find the terms of living together in stable peace and dignity, and we
            shall do all in our power to help them achieve that result.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">--Not far from this scene of conflict, a crisis flared on Cyprus
               involving two peoples who are America's friends: Greece and Turkey.</span> Our
            very able representative, Mr. Cyrus Vance, and others helped to ease
            this tension.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--Turmoil continues on the mainland of China after a year of violent
            disruption. The radical extremism of their Government has isolated the
            Chinese people behind their own borders. The United States, however,
            remains willing to permit the travel of journalists to both our
            countries; to undertake cultural and educational exchanges; and to talk
            about the exchange of basic food crop materials.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Since I spoke to you last, the United States and the Soviet Union have
            taken several important steps toward the goal of international
            cooperation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">As you will remember, I met with Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro and we
            achieved if not accord, at least a clearer understanding of our
            respective positions after 2 days of meeting.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrowed, we have worked
            with the Soviet Union and with other nations to reach an agreement that
            will halt the spread of nuclear weapons. On the basis of communications
            from Ambassador Fisher in Geneva this afternoon, I am encouraged to
            believe that a draft treaty can be laid before the conference in Geneva
            in the very near future. I hope to be able to present that treaty to the
            Senate this year for the Senate's approval.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We achieved, in 1967, a consular treaty with the Soviets, the first
            commercial air agreement between the two countries, and a treaty banning
            weapons in outer space. We shall sign, and submit to the Senate shortly,
            a new treaty with the Soviets and with others for the protection of
            astronauts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Serious differences still remain between us, yet in these relations, we
            have made some progress since Vienna, the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban
            missile crisis.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But despite this progress, we must maintain a military force that is
            capable of deterring any threat to this Nation's security, whatever the
            mode of aggression. Our choices must not be confined to total war--or to
            total acquiescence.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We have such a military force today. We shall maintain it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">I wish--with all of my heart--that the expenditures that are necessary
               to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs
               of peace. But until world conditions permit, and until peace is assured,
               America's might--and America's bravest sons who wear our Nation's
               uniform--must continue to stand guard for all of us--as they gallantly
               do tonight in Vietnam and other places in the world.</span></span></p>
      <p>Yet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the
         conditions of peace.</p>
      <p>For two decades America has committed itself against the tyranny of want
         and ignorance in the world that threatens the peace. We shall sustain
         that commitment. This year I shall propose:</p>
      <p>--That we launch, with other nations, an exploration of the ocean depths
         to tap its wealth, and its energy, and its abundance.</p>
      <p>--That we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the
         International Development Association, and to increase the resources of
         the Asian Development Bank.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="economy">--That we adopt a prudent aid program, rooted in the principle of
               self-help.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--That we renew and extend the food for freedom program.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Our food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of
            famine.</span></p>
      <p>But unless the rapid growth of population in developing countries is
         slowed, the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Governments in the developing countries must take such facts into
            consideration. We in the United States are prepared to help assist them
            in those efforts.</span></p>
      <p>But we must also improve the lives of children already born in the
         villages and towns and cities on this earth. They can be taught by great
         teachers through space communications and the miracle of satellite
         television--and we are going to bring to bear every resource of mind and
         technology to help make this dream come true.</p>
      <p>Let me speak now about some matters here at home.</p>
      <p>Tonight our Nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever
         been accomplished before. <span class="economy">Americans are prosperous as men have never
            been in recorded history.</span> Yet there is in the land a certain
         restlessness--a questioning.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The total of our Nation's annual production is now above $800 billion.
            For 83 months this Nation has been on a steady upward trend of growth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">All about them, most American families can see the evidence of growing
            abundance: higher paychecks, humming factories, new cars moving down new
            highways. More and more families own their own homes, equipped with more
            than 70 million television sets.</span></p>
      <p>A new college is founded every week. Today more than half of the high
         school graduates go on to college.</p>
      <p>There are hundreds of thousands of fathers and mothers who never
         completed grammar school--who will see their children graduate from
         college.</p>
      <p>Why, then, this restlessness?</p>
      <p>Because when a great ship cuts through the sea, the waters are always
         stirred and troubled.</p>
      <p>And our ship is moving. It is moving through troubled and new waters; it
         is moving toward new and better shores.</p>
      <p>We ask now, not how can we achieve abundance?--but how shall we use our
         abundance? Not, is there abundance enough for all?--but, how can all
         share in our abundance?</p>
      <p>While we have accomplished much, much remains for us to meet and much
         remains for us to master.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--In some areas, the jobless rate is still three or four times the
            national average.</span></p>
      <p>--Violence has shown its face in some of our cities.</p>
      <p>--Crime increases on our streets.</p>
      <p>--Income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers; and
         parity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hope--not an
         achievement.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">--New housing construction is far less than we need--to assure decent
            shelter for every family.</span></p>
      <p>--Hospital and medical costs are high, and they are rising.</p>
      <p>--Many rivers--and the air in many cities--remain badly polluted. And
         our citizens suffer from breathing that air.</p>
      <p>We have lived with conditions like these for many, many years. But much
         that we once accepted as inevitable, we now find absolutely intolerable.</p>
      <p>In our cities last summer, we saw how wide is the gulf for some
         Americans between the promise and the reality of our society.</p>
      <p>We know that we cannot change all of this in a day. It represents the
         bitter consequences of more than three centuries.</p>
      <p>But the issue is not whether we can change this; the issue is whether we
         will change this.</p>
      <p>Well, I know we can. And I believe we will.</p>
      <p>This then is the work we should do in the months that are ahead of us in
         this Congress.</p>
      <p>The first essential is more jobs, useful jobs for tens of thousands who
         can become productive and can pay their own way.</p>
      <p>Our economy has created 7 1/2 million new jobs in the past 4 years. It
         is adding more than a million and a half new jobs this year.</p>
      <p>Through programs passed by the Congress, job training is being given
         tonight to more than a million Americans in this country.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">This year, the time has come when we must get to those who are last in
            line--the hard-core unemployed--the hardest to reach.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Employment officials estimate that 500,000 of these persons are now
            unemployed in the major cities of America. Our objective is to place
            these 500,000 in private industry jobs within the next 3 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">To do this, I propose a $2. 1 billion manpower program in the coming
               fiscal year--a 25 percent increase over the current year. Most of this
               increase will be used to start a new partnership between government and
               private industry to train and to hire the hard-core unemployed persons.
               I know of no task before us of more importance to us, to the country, or
               to our future.</span></span></p>
      <p>Another essential is to rebuild our cities.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">Last year the Congress authorized $662 million for the Model Cities
               program. I requested the full amount of that authorization to help meet
               the crisis in the cities of America. But the Congress appropriated only
               $312 million--less than half.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">This year I urge the Congress to honor my request for model cities funds
               to rebuild the centers of American cities by granting us the full amount
               that you in the Congress authorized--$1 billion.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">The next essential is more housing--and more housing now.</span></p>
      <p>Surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within
         the reach of its families.</p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="poverty">Therefore we must call together the resources of industry and labor, to
               start building 300,000 housing units for low- and middle-income families
               next year--that is three times more than this year. We must make it
               possible for thousands of families to become homeowners, not
               rent-payers.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="poverty">I propose, for the consideration of this Congress, a 10-year campaign to
               build 6 million new housing units for low and middle-income families.
               Six million units in the next 10 years. We have built 530,000 the last
               10 years.</span></span></p>
      <p>Better health for our children--all of our children--is essential if we
         are to have a better America.</p>
      <p>Last year, Medicare, Medicaid, and other new programs that you passed in
         the Congress brought better health to more than 25 million Americans.</p>
      <p>American medicine--with the very strong support and cooperation of
         public resources--has produced a phenomenal decline in the death rate
         from many of the dread diseases.</p>
      <p>But it is a shocking fact that, in saving the lives of babies, America
         ranks 15th among the nations of the world. And among children, crippling
         defects are often discovered too late for any corrective action. This is
         a tragedy that Americans can, and Americans should, prevent.</p>
      <p>I shall, therefore, propose to the Congress a child health program to
         provide, over the next 5 years, for families unable to afford it--access
         to health services from prenatal care of the mother through the child's
         first year.</p>
      <p>When we do that you will find it is the best investment we ever made
         because we will get these diseases in their infancy and we will find a
         cure in a great many instances that we can never find by overcrowding
         our hospitals when they are grown.</p>
      <p>Now when we act to advance the consumer's cause I think we help every
         American.</p>
      <p>Last year, with very little fanfare the Congress and the executive
         branch moved in that field.</p>
      <p>We enacted the Wholesome Meat Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the
         Product Safety Commission, and a law to improve clinical laboratories.</p>
      <p>And now, I think, the time has come to complete our unfinished work. The
         Senate has already passed the truth-in-lending bill, the fire safety
         bill, and the pipeline safety laws.</p>
      <p>Tonight I plead with the House to immediately act upon these measures
         and I hope take favorable action upon all of them. I call upon the
         Congress to enact, without delay, the remainder of the 12 vital consumer
         protection laws that I submitted to the Congress last year.</p>
      <p>I also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the
         House to guard against fraud and manipulation in the Nation's commodity
         exchange market.</p>
      <p>These measures are a pledge to our people--to keep them safe in their
         homes and at work, and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace.</p>
      <p>And I think we must do more. I propose:</p>
      <p>--New powers for the Federal Trade Commission to stop those who defraud
         and who swindle our public.</p>
      <p>--New safeguards to insure the quality of fish and poultry, and the
         safety of our community water supplies.</p>
      <p>--A major study of automobile insurance.</p>
      <p>--Protection against hazardous radiation from television sets and other
         electronic equipment.</p>
      <p>And to give the consumer a stronger voice, I plan to appoint a consumer
         counsel in the Justice Department--a lawyer for the American
         consumer--to work directly under the Attorney General, to serve the
         President's Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs, and to serve the
         consumers of this land.</p>
      <p>This Congress--Democrats and Republicans--can earn the thanks of
         history. We can make this truly a new day for the American consumer, and
         by giving him this protection we can live in history as the
         consumer-conscious Congress.</p>
      <p>So let us get on with the work. Let us act soon.</p>
      <p>We, at every level of the government, State, local, Federal, know that
         the American people have had enough of rising crime and lawlessness in
         this country.</p>
      <p>They recognize that law enforcement is first the duty of local police
         and local government.</p>
      <p>They recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime is in the
         home, the church, the city hall and the county courthouse and the
         statehouse--not in the far-removed National Capital of Washington.</p>
      <p>But the people also recognize that the National Government can and the
         National Government should help the cities and the States in their war
         on crime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional
         authority. And this we shall do.</p>
      <p>This does not mean a national police force. It does mean help and
         financial support:</p>
      <p>--to develop State and local master plans to combat crime,</p>
      <p>--to provide better training and better pay for police, and</p>
      <p>--to bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every
         city and every county in America.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">There is no more urgent business before this Congress than to pass the
               Safe Streets Act this year that I proposed last year. That law will
               provide these required funds. They are so critically needed that I have
               doubled my request under this act to $100 million in fiscal 1969.</span></span></p>
      <p>And I urge the Congress to stop the trade in mail-order murder, to stop
         it this year by adopting a proper gun control law.</p>
      <p>This year, I will propose a Drug Control Act to provide stricter
         penalties for those who traffic in LSD and other dangerous drugs with
         our people.</p>
      <p>I will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug laws by
         increasing the number of Federal drug and narcotics control officials by
         more than 30 percent. The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to
         the young. I also request you to give us funds to add immediately 100
         assistant United States attorneys throughout the land to help prosecute
         our criminal laws. We have increased our judiciary by 40 percent and we
         have increased our prosecutors by 16 percent. The dockets are full of
         cases because we don't have assistant district attorneys to go before
         the Federal judge and handle them. We start these young lawyers at
         $8,200 a year. And the docket is clogged because we don't have authority
         to hire more of them.</p>
      <p>I ask the Congress for authority to hire 100 more. These young men will
         give special attention to this drug abuse, too.</p>
      <p>Finally, I ask you to add 100 FBI agents to strengthen law enforcement
         in the Nation and to protect the individual rights of every citizen.</p>
      <p>A moment ago I spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where
         the fires of disorder burned last summer. We can--and in time we
         will--change that despair into confidence, and change those frustrations
         into achievements. But violence will never bring progress.</p>
      <p>We can make progress only by attacking the causes of violence and only
         where there is civil order founded on justice.</p>
      <p>Today we are helping local officials improve their capacity to deal
         promptly with disorders.</p>
      <p>Those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that
         local authorities are able to resist them swiftly, to resist them
         sternly, and to resist them decisively.</p>
      <p>I shall recommend other actions:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">--To raise the farmers' income by establishing a security commodity
            reserve that will protect the market from price-depressing stocks and
            protect the consumer from food scarcity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--I shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively
            for fair prices.</span></p>
      <p>--I shall recommend programs for new air safety measures.</p>
      <p>--Measures to stem the rising costs of medical care.</p>
      <p>--Legislation to encourage our returning veterans to devote themselves
         to careers in community service such as teaching, and being firemen, and
         joining our police force, and our law enforcement officials.</p>
      <p>--I shall recommend programs to strengthen and finance our
         anti-pollution efforts.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">--Fully funding all of the $2.18 billion poverty program that you in the
            Congress had just authorized in order to bring opportunity to those who
            have been left far behind.</span></p>
      <p>--I shall recommend an Educational Opportunity Act to speed up our drive
         to break down the financial barriers that are separating our young
         people from college.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I shall also urge the Congress to act on several other vital pending
            bills--especially the civil rights measures--fair jury trials,
            protection of Federal rights, enforcement of equal employment
            opportunity, and fair housing.</span></p>
      <p>The unfinished work of the first session must be completed--the Higher
         Education Act, the Juvenile Delinquency Act, conservation measures to
         save the redwoods of California, and to preserve the wonders of our
         scenic rivers, the Highway Beautification Act--and all the other
         measures for a cleaner, and for a better, and for a more beautiful
         America.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Next month we'll begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity. The
            economic outlook for this year is one of steady growth--if we are
            vigilant.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">True, there are some clouds on the horizon. Prices are rising. Interest
            rates have passed the peak of 1966; and if there is continued inaction
            on the tax bill, they will climb even higher.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I warn the Congress and the Nation tonight that this failure to act on
            the tax bill will sweep us into an accelerating spiral of price
            increases, a slump in homebuilding, and a continuing erosion of the
            American dollar.</span></p>
      <p>This would be a tragedy for every American family. And I predict that if
         this happens, they will all let us know about it.</p>
      <p>We--those of us in the executive branch, in the Congress, and the
         leaders of labor and business--must do everything we can to prevent that
         kind of misfortune.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Under the new budget, the expenditures for 1969 will increase by $10.4
            billion. Receipts will increase by $22.3 billion including the added tax
            revenues. Virtually all of this expenditure increase represents the
            mandatory cost of our defense efforts, $3 billion; increased interest,
            almost $1 billion; or mandatory payments under laws passed by
            Congress--such as those provided in the Social Security Act that you
            passed in 1967, and to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, veterans,
            and farmers, of about $4 1/2 billion; and the additional $1 billion 600
            million next year for the pay increases that you passed in military and
            civilian pay. That makes up the $10 billion that is added to the budget.
            With few exceptions, very few, we are holding the fiscal 1969 budget to
            last year's level, outside of those mandatory and required increases.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">A Presidential commission composed of distinguished congressional fiscal
            leaders and other prominent Americans recommended this year that we
            adopt a new budget approach. I am carrying out their recommendations in
            this year's budget. This budget, therefore, for the first time
            accurately covers all Federal expenditures and all Federal receipts,
            including for the first time in one budget $47 billion from the social
            security, Medicare, highway, and other trust funds.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The fiscal 1969 budget has expenditures of approximately $186 billion,
            with total estimated revenues, including the tax bill, of about $178
            billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">If the Congress enacts the tax increase, we will reduce the budget
            deficit by some $12 billion. The war in Vietnam is costing us about $25
            billion and we are asking for about $12 billion in taxes--and if we get
            that $12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $20
            billion in 1968 to about $8 billion in 1969.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, this is a tight budget. It follows the reduction that I made in
            cooperation with the Congress--a reduction made after you had reviewed
            every appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $5 or
            $6 billion and expenditures by $1.5 billion. We conferred together and I
            recommended to the Congress and you subsequently approved taking 2
            percent from payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures. We
            therefore reduced appropriations almost $10 billion last session and
            expenditures over $4 billion. Now, that was in the budget last year.</span></p>
      <p>I ask the Congress to recognize that there are certain selected programs
         that meet the Nation's most urgent needs and they have increased. We
         have insisted that decreases in very desirable but less urgent programs
         be made before we would approve any increases. So I ask the Congress
         tonight:</p>
      <p>--<span class="economy">to hold its appropriations to the budget requests, and</span></p>
      <p>--<span class="economy">to act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which
            for the average American individual amounts to about a penny out of each
            dollar's income.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This tax increase would yield about half of the $23 billion per year
            that we returned to the people in the tax reduction bills of 1964 and
            1965.</span></p>
      <p>This must be a temporary measure, which expires in less than 2 years.
         Congress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed. But Congress can
         never repeal inflation.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The leaders of American business and the leaders of American
            labor--those who really have power over wages and prices--must act
            responsibly, and in their Nation's interest by keeping increases in line
            with productivity. If our recognized leaders do not do this, they and
            those for whom they speak and all of us are going to suffer very serious
            consequences.</span></p>
      <p>On January 1st, I outlined a program to reduce our balance of payments
         deficit sharply this year. We will ask the Congress to help carry out
         those parts of the program which require legislation. We must restore
         equilibrium to our balance of payments.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must also strengthen the international monetary system. We have
            assured the world that America's full gold stock stands behind our
            commitment to maintain the price of gold at $35 an ounce. We must back
            this commitment by legislating now to free our gold reserves.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Americans, traveling more than any other people in history, took $4
            billion out of their country last year in travel costs. We must try to
            reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $2 billion. We are
            hoping that we can reduce it by $500 million--without unduly penalizing
            the travel of teachers, students, business people who have essential and
            necessary travel, or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to
            see. Even with this reduction of $500 million, the American people will
            still be traveling more overseas than they did in 1967, 1966, or 1965 or
            any other year in their history.</span></p>
      <p>If we act together as I hope we can, I believe we can continue our
         economic expansion which has already broken all past records. And I hope
         that we can continue that expansion in the days ahead.</p>
      <p>Each of these questions I have discussed with you tonight is a question
         of policy for our people. Therefore, each of them should be--and
         doubtless will be--debated by candidates for public office this year.</p>
      <p>I hope those debates will be marked by new proposals and by a
         seriousness that matches the gravity of the questions themselves.</p>
      <p>These are not appropriate subjects for narrow partisan oratory. They go
         to the heart of what we Americans are all about--all of us, Democrats
         and Republicans.</p>
      <p>Tonight I have spoken of some of the goals I should like to see America
         reach. Many of them can be achieved this year--others by the time we
         celebrate our Nation's 200th birthday--the bicentennial of our
         independence.</p>
      <p>Several of these goals are going to be very hard to reach. But the State
         of our Union will be much stronger 8 years from now on our 200th
         birthday if we resolve to reach these goals now. They are more
         important--much more important--than the identity of the party or the
         President who will then be in office.</p>
      <p>These goals are what the fighting and our alliances are really meant to
         protect.</p>
      <p>Can we achieve these goals?</p>
      <p>Of course we can--if we will.</p>
      <p>If ever there was a people who sought more than mere abundance, it is
         our people.</p>
      <p>If ever there was a nation that was capable of solving its problems, it
         is this Nation.</p>
      <p>If ever there were a time to know the pride and the excitement and the
         hope of being an American--it is this time.</p>
      <p>So this, my friends, is the State of our Union: seeking, building,
         tested many times in this past year--and always equal to the test.</p>
      <p>Thank you and good night.

      <h3>January 14, 1969</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress and my fellow
         Americans:</p>
      <p>For the sixth and the last time, I present to the Congress my assessment
         of the State of the Union.</p>
      <p>I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity--and about
         the commitments that all of us have made together that will, if we carry
         them out, give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great
         society that we all want. Every President lives, not only with what is,
         but with what has been and what could be.</p>
      <p>Most of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence
         extending back through several years and extending back through several
         other administrations.</p>
      <p>Urban unrest, poverty, pressures on welfare, education of our people,
         law enforcement and law and order, the continuing crisis in the Middle
         East, the conflict in Vietnam, the dangers of nuclear war, the great
         difficulties of dealing with the Communist powers, all have this much in
         common: They and their causes--the causes that gave rise to them--all of
         these have existed with us for many years. Several Presidents have
         already sought to try to deal with them. One or more Presidents will try
         to resolve them or try to contain them in the years that are ahead of
         us.</p>
      <p>But if the Nation's problems are continuing, so are this great Nation's
         assets:</p>
      <p>--our economy,</p>
      <p>--the democratic system,</p>
      <p>--our sense of exploration, symbolized most recently by the wonderful
         flight of the Apollo 8, in which all Americans took great pride,</p>
      <p>--the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people, and</p>
      <p>--their essential love of justice.</p>
      <p>We must not ignore our problems. But .neither should we ignore our
         strengths. Those strengths are available to sustain a President of
         either party--to support his progressive efforts both at home and
         overseas.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the departure of an administration does not mean the end
         of the problems that this administration has faced. The effort to meet
         the problems must go on, year after year, if the momentum that we have
         all mounted together in these past years is not to be lost.</p>
      <p>Although the struggle for progressive change is continuous, there are
         times when a watershed is reached--when there is--if not really a break
         with the past--at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes, and
         a stepping forth into a new environment, to seek new goals. I think the
         past 5 years have been such a time.</p>
      <p>We have finished a major part of the old agenda.</p>
      <p>Some of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken
         on the flesh of achievement.</p>
      <p>Medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of
         American life.</p>
      <p>Voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the
         riffles, and the doors to public service, are open at last to all
         Americans regardless of their color.</p>
      <p>Schools and school children all over America tonight are receiving
         Federal assistance to go to good schools.</p>
      <p>Preschool education--Head Start--is already here to stay and, I think,
         so are the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million
         and a half of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the
         universities of this country.</p>
      <p>Part of the American earth--not only in description on a map, but in the
         reality of our shores, our hills, our parks, our forests, and our
         mountains--has been permanently set aside for the American public and
         for their benefit. And there is more that will be set aside before this
         administration ends.</p>
      <p>Five million Americans have been trained for jobs in new Federal
         programs.</p>
      <p>I think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this
         Nation is close to full employment--with less unemployment than we have
         had at any time in almost 20 years. That is not in theory; that is in
         fact. Tonight, the unemployment rate is down to 3.3 percent. The number
         of jobs has grown more than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 years. That is
         more than in all the preceding 12 years.</p>
      <p>These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and,
         finally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.</p>
      <p>I wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and
         the administration achieved during this period had already completed
         that cycle. But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional
         funding to become a tangible realization.</p>
      <p>Yet the very existence of these commitments--these promises to the
         American people, made by this Congress and by the executive branch of
         the Government--are achievements in themselves, and failure to carry
         through on our commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation.</p>
      <p>This much is certain: No one man or group of men made these commitments
         alone. Congress and the executive branch, with their checks and
         balances, reasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the
         land. They now have all the moral force that the American political
         system can summon when it acts as one.</p>
      <p>They express America's common determination to achieve goals. They imply
         action.</p>
      <p>In most cases, you have already begun that action--but it is not fully
         completed, of course.</p>
      <p>Let me speak for a moment about these commitments. I am going to speak
         in the language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these
         measures. I am going to quote from your words.</p>
      <p>In 1966, Congress declared that "improving the quality of urban life is
         the most critical domestic problem facing the United States." Two years
         later it affirmed the historic goal of "a decent home . . . for every
         American family." That is your language.</p>
      <p>Now to meet these commitments, we must increase our support for the
         model cities program, where blueprints of change are already being
         prepared in more than 150 American cities.</p>
      <p>To achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already
         passed, we should begin this year more than 500,000 homes for needy
         families in the coming fiscal year. Funds are provided in the new budget
         to do just this. This is almost 10 times--10 times--the average rate of
         the past 10 years.</p>
      <p>Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs
         of their growing populations. So I believe an urban development bank
         should be created by the Congress. This bank could obtain resources
         through the issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these
         resources at reduced rates to the communities throughout the land for
         schools, hospitals, parks, and other public facilities.</p>
      <p>Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935, Congress has
         recognized the necessity to "make more adequate provision for aged
         persons . . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public
         health." Those are the words of the Congress--"more adequate."</p>
      <p>The time has come, I think, to make it more adequate. I believe we
         should increase social security benefits, and I am so recommending
         tonight.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of
            at least 13 percent. Those who receive only the minimum of $55 should
            get $80 a month.</span></p>
      <p>Our Nation, too, is rightfully proud of our medical advances. But we
         should remember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the
         world in its infant mortality rate.</p>
      <p>I think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother
         and for their children during the first year of their life in the United
         States of America.</p>
      <p>I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs
         of catastrophic illness.</p>
      <p>As we pass on from medicine, I think nothing is clearer to the Congress
         than the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty. Congress
         expressed it well, I think, in 1964, when they said: "It is the policy
         of the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of
         plenty in this nation."</p>
      <p>This is the richest nation in the world. The antipoverty program has had
         many achievements. It also has some failures. But we must not cripple it
         after only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been
         with us and have been building up among us for generations.</p>
      <p>I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration
         of the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring
         them to other agencies. I believe, though, it will want to continue,
         until we have broken the back of poverty, the efforts we are now making
         throughout this land.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I believe, and I hope the next administration--I believe they
            believe--that the key to success in this effort is jobs. It is work for
            people who want to work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the budget for fiscal 1970, I shall recommend a total of $3.5 billion
            for our job training program, and that is five times as much as we spent
            in 1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their
            own living.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The Nation's commitment in the field of civil rights began with the
            Declaration of Independence. They were extended by the 13th, 14th, and
            15th amendments. They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment
            of three far-reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years, that
            this Congress, in its wisdom, passed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">On January 1 of this year, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20
            million American homes and apartments. The prohibition against racial
            discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be
            vigorously enforced throughout this land.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting
            Rights Act for another 5 years.</span></p>
      <p>In the Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress determined "To assist state
         and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime."</p>
      <p>This year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full $300 million
         that the Congress last year authorized to do just that.</p>
      <p>I hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is.</p>
      <p>I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public
         order in the United States. I hope these grants can be made to the
         States and they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this
         country.</p>
      <p>But all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be
         made--I think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nation--if
         we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest.</p>
      <p>Frankly, as I leave the Office of the Presidency, one of my greatest
         disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and
         registration act for firearms. I think if we had passed that act, it
         would have reduced the incidence of crime. I believe that the Congress
         should adopt such a law, and I hope that it will at a not too distant
         date.</p>
      <p>In order to meet our long-standing commitment to make government as
         efficient as possible, I believe that we should reorganize our postal
         system along the lines of the Kappel[1] report.</p>
      <p>[Footnote 1: Frederick R. Kappel, Chairman of the Commission on
         Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries.]</p>
      <p><span class="war">I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an
            unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve
            their country.</span></p>
      <p>I believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive,
         Legislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound. Later this week,
         I shall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership
         this evening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has
         modified the Commission's recommendation to some extent on the
         congressional salaries.</p>
      <p>For Members of Congress, I will recommend the basic compensation not of
         the $50,000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the
         other distinguished Members, but I shall reduce that $50,000 to $42,500.
         I will suggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional
         allowance for official expenses, so that Members will not be required to
         use their salary increase for essential official business.</p>
      <p>I would have submitted the Commission's recommendations, except the
         advice that I received from the leadership--and you usually are
         consulted about matters that affect the Congress--was that the Congress
         would not accept the $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my
         recommendation to be seriously considered, I should make substantial
         reductions. That is the only reason I didn't go along with the Kappel
         report.</p>
      <p>In 1967 I recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random
         selection system for the draft. I submit it again tonight for your most
         respectful consideration.</p>
      <p>I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet
         all of these commitments I talk about will cost money. If we maintain
         the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past
         8 years, I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet
         these commitments.</p>
      <p>We have already been able to increase our support for major social
         programs--<span class="war">although we have heard a lot about not being able to do
            anything on the home front because of Vietnam;</span> but we have been able in
         the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health
         and education from $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming
         fiscal year. That is more than double. That is more than it has ever
         been increased in the 188 years of this Republic, notwithstanding
         Vietnam.</p>
      <p>We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in
         a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress
            last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last
            January when we made our estimates. At that time, you will remember that
            we estimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion. Well, I am glad to
            report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this
            June, we are going to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a
            $2.4 billion surplus.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">You will receive the budget tomorrow. The budget for the next fiscal
            year, that begins July 1--which you will want to examine very carefully
            in the days ahead--will provide a $3.4 billion surplus.</span></p>
      <p>This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress
         enacted last year. I have communicated with the President-elect, Mr.
         Nixon, in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the
         time being.</p>
      <p>I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon
         as circumstances will permit, but the President-elect has told me that
         he has concluded that until his administration, and this Congress, can
         examine the appropriation bills, and each item in the budget, and can
         ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to
         be reduced, he, Mr. Nixon, will support my recommendation that the
         surtax be continued.</p>
      <p>Americans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will
         bring an early peace to Vietnam. And if our hopes for an early
         settlement of the war are realized, then our military expenditures can
         be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other
         desirable purposes, as the Congress may determine.</p>
      <p>In any event, I think it is imperative that we do all that we
         responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity. <span class="economy">I
            think all Americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep,
            and it has brought record profits, the highest in our history, and
            record wages</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any
            other period in our Nation's history. Our wages have been the highest.
            Our profits have been the best. This prosperity has enabled millions to
            escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few
            years</span>.</p>
      <p>I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the
         Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we
         have achieved a surplus. It appears that we have, in fact, done better
         this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year
         1957.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every
            administration since the end of World War II.</span> It has required us to seek
         a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers, but among the
         smaller nations as well. We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963,
         the outer space treaty of 1967, and the treaty against the spread of
         nuclear weapons in 1968.</p>
      <p>This latter agreement--the nonproliferation treaty--is now pending in
         the Senate and it has been pending there since last July. In my opinion,
         delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace.
         America took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now
         take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date.</p>
      <p>Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the
         superpowers, mankind cannot view the future without fear and great
         apprehension. <span class="war">So, I believe that we should resume the talks with the
            Soviet Union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems. I
            think they would already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and
            our election this year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to
            aid the developing nations.</span> We knew then that we could not live in good
         conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">During these years there have been great advances made under our
            program, particularly against want and hunger, although we are
            disappointed at the appropriations last year.</span> We thought they were
         woefully inadequate. This year I am asking for adequate funds for
         economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the
         world.</p>
      <p>I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation.
         Among those efforts, that of Western Europe has a very special place in
         America's concern.</p>
      <p>The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world
         role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity. I think
         America remains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner
         on the basis of equality.</p>
      <p>For the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires:</p>
      <p>--that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become
         the leading nation in world trade,</p>
      <p>--that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument
         of world prosperity, and</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--that we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the
            interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly
            served.</span></p>
      <p>The strained relationship between us and the world's leading Communist
         power has not ended--especially in the light of the brutal invasion of
         Czechoslovakia. But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we
         are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world
         catastrophe.</p>
      <p><span class="war">What we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world. We earnestly
            hope that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and
            individual freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam, and in the Paris
            talks.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to
            restore peace to South Vietnam.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The prospects, I think, for peace are better today than at any time
            since North Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than
            4 years ago.</span></p>
      <p>The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time:
         that America cares about their freedom, and it also cares about
         America's own vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific.</p>
      <p>The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive
         purposes by force. There may be hard fighting before a settlement is
         reached; but, I can assure you, it will yield no victory to the
         Communist cause.</p>
      <p><span class="war">I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very
            personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for
            all of us. I have been honored to be their Commander in Chief. The
            Nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continues--and
            its enduring gratitude when their service is done.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Finally, the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many
            capitals tonight. America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the
            U.N. Security Council which points the way. There must be a settlement
            of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today. It
            is a threat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States, but it is a
            threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well.</span></p>
      <p>Now, my friends in Congress, I want to conclude with a few very personal
         words to you.</p>
      <p>I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional
         leadership's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in
         person tonight.</p>
      <p>I did that for two reasons. One was philosophical. I wanted to give you
         my judgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I
         view them, before I leave.</p>
      <p>The other was just pure sentimental. Most all of my life as a public
         official has been spent here in this building. For 38 years--since I
         worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of
         Representatives--I have known these halls, and I have known most of the
         men pretty well who walked them.</p>
      <p>I know the questions that you face. I know the conflicts that you
         endure. I know the ideals that you seek to serve.</p>
      <p>I left here first to become Vice President, and then to become, in a
         moment of tragedy, the President of the United States.</p>
      <p>My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges, both at
         home and throughout the world.</p>
      <p>In meeting some of these challenges, the Nation has found a new
         confidence. In meeting others, it knew turbulence and doubt, and fear
         and hate.</p>
      <p>Throughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in
         representative democracy--a faith that I had learned here in this
         Capitol Building as an employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator.</p>
      <p>I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation--described by
         the Constitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and
         given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow
         citizens.</p>
      <p>Now for 5 most demanding years in the White House, I have been
         strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former
         Presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower. I have been
         guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the
         beloved John F. Kennedy, and with our greatest modern legislator,
         Speaker Sam Rayburn.</p>
      <p>I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way, Vice President
         Hubert Humphrey. I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by
         the loyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert.</p>
      <p>I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield, and I am
         sure that I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense
         counsel of the President Pro Tem of the Senate, Senator Richard Brevard
         Russell.</p>
      <p>I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the
         Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, Senator Dirksen
         and Congressman Gerald Ford, the Minority Leader.</p>
      <p>No President should ask for more, although I did upon occasions. But few
         Presidents have ever been blessed with so much.</p>
      <p>President-elect Nixon, in the days ahead, is going to need your
         understanding, just as I did. And he is entitled to have it. I hope
         every Member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our
         President, will be borne for all of us. Each of us should try not to
         increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan
         advantage.</p>
      <p>Now, it is time to leave. I hope it may be said, a hundred years from
         now, that by working together we helped to make our country more just,
         more just for all of its people, as well as to insure and guarantee the
         blessings of liberty for all of our posterity.</p>
      <p>That is what I hope. But I believe that at least it will be said that we
         tried.

      <h3>January 22, 1970</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our
         distinguished guests and my fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>To address a joint session of the Congress in this great Chamber in
         which I was once privileged to serve is an honor for which I am deeply
         grateful.</p>
      <p>The State of the Union Address is traditionally an occasion for a
         lengthy and detailed account by the President of what he has
         accomplished in the past, what he wants the Congress to do in the
         future, and, in an election year, to lay the basis for the political
         issues which might be decisive in the fall.</p>
      <p>Occasionally there comes a time when profound and far-reaching events
         command a break with tradition. This is such a time.</p>
      <p>I say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade in
         which America will celebrate its 200th birthday. I say it because new
         knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs
         and our institutions in America need to be reformed.</p>
      <p>The moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of
         this land to the creation of a new American experience, an experience
         richer and deeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace
         of the human spirit.</p>
      <p>The seventies will be a time of new beginnings, a time of exploring both
         on the earth and in the heavens, a time of discovery. But the time has
         also come for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we
         have and of completing what man's genius has begun but left unfinished.</p>
      <p>Our land, this land that is ours together, is a great and a good land.
         It is also an unfinished land, and the challenge of perfecting it is the
         summons of the seventies.</p>
      <p>It is in that spirit that I address myself to those great issues facing
         our Nation which are above partisanship.</p>
      <p>When we speak of America's priorities the first priority must always be
         peace for America and the world.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the
            war in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered not so
            much as the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that
            we had the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that
            the next generation was able to keep</span>.</p>
      <p>We are making progress toward that goal.</p>
      <p>The prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago.</p>
      <p><span class="war">A major part of the credit for this development goes to the Members of
            this Congress who, despite their differences on the conduct of the war,
            have overwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace.</span> By this
         action, you have completely demolished the enemy's hopes that they can
         gain in Washington the victory our fighting men have denied them in
         Vietnam.</p>
      <p>No goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in
         this century in which America was at peace with every nation in the
         world.</p>
      <p>I shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to
         achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy, which I shall
         submit to the Congress at a later date.</p>
      <p>Today, let me describe the directions of our new policies.</p>
      <p>We have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is, not
         as it was 25 years ago at the conclusion of World War II. Many of the
         policies which were necessary and right then are obsolete today.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Then, because of America's overwhelming military and <span class="economy">economic strength,</span>
            because of the weakness of other major free world powers and the
            inability of scores of newly independent nations to defend, or even
            govern, themselves, America had to assume the major burden for the
            defense of freedom in the world</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In two wars, first in Korea and now in Vietnam, we furnished most of the
            money, most of the arms, most of the men to help other nations defend
            their freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Today the great industrial nations of Europe, as well as Japan, have
            regained their economic strength; and the nations of Latin America-</span>-and
         many of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after
         World War II in Asia and Africa--have a new sense of pride and dignity
         and a determination to assume the responsibility for their own defense.</p>
      <p>That is the basis of the doctrine I announced at Guam.</p>
      <p>Neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be
         exclusively or primarily an American undertaking.</p>
      <p>The nations of each part of the world should assume the primary
         responsibility for their own well-being; and they themselves should
         determine the terms of that well-being.</p>
      <p>We shall be faithful to our treaty commitments, but we shall reduce our
         involvement and our presence in other nations' affairs.</p>
      <p>To insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from
         responsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.</p>
      <p>The result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances, but
         to give them new life, new strength, a new sense of common purpose.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Relations with our European allies are once again strong and healthy,
            based on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility.</span></p>
      <p>We have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal with
         those nations as partners rather than patrons.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The new partnership concept has been welcomed in Asia. We have developed
            an historic new basis for Japanese-American friendship and cooperation,
            which is the linchpin for peace in the Pacific.</span></p>
      <p>If we are to have peace in the last third of the century, a major factor
         will be the development of a new relationship between the United States
         and the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>I would not underestimate our differences, but we are moving with
         precision and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of
         negotiation.</p>
      <p>Our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will
         have far greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated
         by mutual self-interest rather than naive sentimentality.</p>
      <p>It is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with
         Communist China in our talks at Warsaw.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a
            catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful
            settlement of our differences.</span></p>
      <p>I would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult
         and dangerous, but I believe our new policies have contributed to the
         prospect that America may have the best chance since World War II to
         enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace. And that chance will be
         enormously increased if we continue to have a relationship between
         Congress and the Executive in which, despite differences in detail,
         where the security of America and the peace of mankind are concerned, we
         act not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.</p>
      <p>As we move into the decade of the seventies, we have the greatest
         opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our gross national product will increase by $500 billion in the next 10
            years. This increase alone is greater than the entire growth of the
            American economy from 1790 to 1950.</span></p>
      <p>The critical question is not whether we will grow, but how we will use
         that growth.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth
            economically. </span>But in that same 10-year period we witnessed the greatest
         growth of crime, the greatest increase in inflation, the greatest social
         unrest in America in 100 years. Never has a nation seemed to have had
         more and enjoyed it less.</p>
      <p>At heart, the issue is the effectiveness of government.</p>
      <p>Ours has become--as it continues to be, and should remain--a society of
         large expectations. Government helped to generate these expectations. It
         undertook to meet them. Yet, increasingly, it proved unable to do so.</p>
      <p>As a people, we had too many visions--and too little vision.</p>
      <p>Now, as we enter the seventies, we should enter also a great age of
         reform of the institutions of American government.</p>
      <p>Our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the
         programs of the past. The time has come for a new quest--a quest not for
         a greater quantity of what we have, but for a new quality of life in
         America.</p>
      <p>A major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this
         Nation's approach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more
         than two score legislative proposals which I sent to the Congress last
         year and which still await enactment.</p>
      <p>I will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this
         session.</p>
      <p>At this point I do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what I
         have proposed or will propose, but I would like to mention three areas
         in which urgent priorities demand that we move and move now:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of our
            welfare system.</span> When a system penalizes work, breaks up homes, robs
         recipients of dignity, there is no alternative to abolishing that system
         and adopting in its place the program of income support, job training,
         and work incentives which I recommended to the Congress last year.</p>
      <p>Second, the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions
         of government at the Federal, State, and local level. It is time for a
         New Federalism, in which, after 190 years of power flowing from the
         people and local and State governments to Washington, D.C., it will
         begin to flow from Washington back to the States and to the people of
         the United States.</p>
      <p>Third, we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of
         opportunities for all Americans.<span class="civil-rights"> We can fulfill the American dream only
            when each person has a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams. This means
            equal voting rights, equal employment opportunity, and new opportunities
            for expanded ownership. Because in order to be secure in their human
            rights, people need access to property rights.</span></p>
      <p>I could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for
         health, education, housing, transportation, as well as other critical
         areas which directly affect the well-being of millions of Americans.</p>
      <p>The people of the United States should wait no longer for these reforms
         that would so deeply enhance the quality of their life.</p>
      <p>When I speak of actions which would be beneficial to the American
         people, I can think of none more important than for the Congress to join
         this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of
         living.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, I realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation. Some
            blame business for raising prices. Some blame unions for asking for more
            wages.</span></p>
      <p>But a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960's clearly
         demonstrates where the primary blame for rising prices must be placed.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the decade of the sixties the Federal Government spent $57 billion
            more than it took in in taxes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In that same decade the American people paid the bill for that deficit
            in price increases which raised the cost of living for the average
            family of four by $200 per month in America.</span></p>
      <p>Now millions of Americans are forced to go into debt today because the
         Federal Government decided to go into debt yesterday. We must balance
         our Federal budget so that American families will have a better chance
         to balance their family budgets.</p>
      <p>Only with the cooperation of the Congress can we meet this highest
         priority objective of responsible government. We are on the right track.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We had a balanced budget in 1969. This administration cut more than $7
            billion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970, and
            in spite of the fact that Congress reduced revenues by $3 billion, I
            shall recommend a balanced budget for 1971.</span></p>
      <p>But I can assure you that not only to present, but to stay within, a
         balanced budget requires some very hard decisions. It means rejecting
         spending programs which would benefit some of the people when their net
         effect would result in price increases for all the people.</p>
      <p>It is time to quit putting good money into bad programs. Otherwise, we
         will end up with bad money and bad programs.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I recognize the political popularity of spending programs, and
            particularly in an election year. But unless we stop the rise in prices,
            the cost of living for millions of American families will become
            unbearable and government's ability to plan programs for progress for
            the future will become impossible.</span></p>
      <p>In referring to budget cuts, there is one area where I have ordered an
         increase rather than a cut--and that is the requests of those agencies
         with the responsibilities for law enforcement.</p>
      <p>We have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in
         which the word "war" has perhaps too often been used--<span class="war">the war on
            poverty,</span> the war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger. But
         if there is one area where the word "war" is appropriate it is in the
         fight against crime. We must declare and win the war against the
         criminal elements which increasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and
         our lives.</p>
      <p>We have a tragic example of this problem in the Nation's Capital, for
         whose safety the Congress and the Executive have the primary
         responsibility. I doubt if many Members of this Congress who live more
         than a few blocks from here would dare leave their cars in the Capitol
         garage and walk home alone tonight.</p>
      <p>Last year this administration sent to the Congress 13 separate pieces of
         legislation dealing with organized crime, pornography, street crime,
         narcotics, crime in the District of Columbia.</p>
      <p>None of these bills has reached my desk for signature.</p>
      <p>I am confident that the Congress will act now to adopt the legislation I
         placed before you last year. We in the Executive have done everything we
         can under existing law, but new and stronger weapons are needed in that
         fight.</p>
      <p>While it is true that State and local law enforcement agencies are the
         cutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime, burglaries,
         murder, my proposals to you have embodied my belief that the Federal
         Government should play a greater role in working in partnership with
         these agencies.</p>
      <p>That is why 1971 Federal spending for local law enforcement will double
         that budgeted for 1970.</p>
      <p>The primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with
         local and State rather than with Federal Government. But in the field of
         organized crime, narcotics, pornography, the Federal Government has a
         special responsibility it should fulfill. And we should make Washington,
         D.C., where we have the primary responsibility, an example to the Nation
         and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness.</p>
      <p>I now turn to a subject which, next to our desire for peace, may well
         become the major concern of the American people in the decade of the
         seventies.</p>
      <p>In the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent. The
         profound question is: Does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a
         real sense, 50 percent better off, 50 percent happier?</p>
      <p>Or does it mean that in the year 1980 the President standing in this
         place will look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived
         in metropolitan areas choked by traffic, suffocated by smog, poisoned by
         water, deafened by noise, and terrorized by crime?</p>
      <p>These are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summit
         conferences. But people do not live at the summit. They live in the
         foothills of everyday experience, and it is time for all of us to
         concern ourselves with the way real people live in real life.</p>
      <p>The great question of the seventies is, shall we surrender to our
         surroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make
         reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to
         our water?</p>
      <p>Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond
         factions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this
         country. It is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because
         they more than we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act
         on programs which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later.</p>
      <p>Clean air, clean water, open spaces--these should once again be the
         birthright of every American. If we act now, they can be.</p>
      <p>We still think of air as free. But clean air is not free, and neither is
         clean water. The price tag on pollution control is high. Through our
         years of past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature, and now that
         debt is being called.</p>
      <p>The program I shall propose to Congress will be the most comprehensive
         and costly program in this field in America's history.</p>
      <p>It is not a program for just one year. A year's plan in this field is no
         plan at all. This is a time to look ahead not a year, but 5 years or 10
         years--whatever time is required to do the job.</p>
      <p>I shall propose to this Congress a $10 billion nationwide clean waters
         program to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in
         America where they are needed to make our waters clean again, and do it
         now. <span class="infra">We have the industrial capacity, if we begin now, to build them all
            within 5 years. This program will get them built within 5 years.</span></p>
      <p>As our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand, those priceless open
         spaces needed for recreation areas accessible to their people are
         swallowed up--often forever. Unless we preserve these spaces while they
         are still available, we will have none to preserve. Therefore, I shall
         propose new financing methods for purchasing open space and parklands
         now, before they are lost to us.</p>
      <p>The automobile is our worst polluter of the air. Adequate control
         requires further advances in engine design and fuel composition. We
         shall intensify our research, set increasingly strict standards, and
         strengthen enforcement procedures--and we shall do it now.</p>
      <p>We can no longer afford to consider air and water common property, free
         to be abused by anyone without regard to the consequences. Instead, we
         should begin now to treat them as scarce resources, which we are no more
         free to contaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our
         neighbor's yard.</p>
      <p>This requires comprehensive new regulations. It also requires that, to
         the extent possible, the price of goods should be made to include the
         costs of producing and disposing of them without damage to the
         environment.</p>
      <p>Now, I realize that the argument is often made that there is a
         fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of
         life, so that to have one we must forsake the other.</p>
      <p>The answer is not to abandon growth, but to redirect it. For example, we
         should turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the same
         reservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Continued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrich
            life itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man</span>.</p>
      <p>Each individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won.</p>
      <p>It has been said that no matter how many national parks and historical
         monuments we buy and develop, the truly significant environment for each
         of us is that in which we spend 80 percent of our time--in our homes, in
         our places of work, the streets over which we travel.</p>
      <p>Street litter, rundown parking strips and yards, dilapidated fences,
         broken windows, smoking automobiles, dingy working places, all should be
         the object of our fresh view.</p>
      <p>We have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave
         it to others to clean up our environment. It is time for those who make
         massive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves.
         Each of us must resolve that each day he will leave his home, his
         property, the public places of the city or town a little cleaner, a
         little better, a little more pleasant for himself and those around him.</p>
      <p>With the help of people we can do anything, and without their help, we
         can do nothing. In this spirit, together, we can reclaim our land for
         ours and generations to come.</p>
      <p>Between now and the year 2000, over 100 million children will be born in
         the United States. Where they grow up--and how--will, more than any one
         thing, measure the quality of American life in these years ahead.</p>
      <p>This should be a warning to us.</p>
      <p>For the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting.
         The result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural America emptying
         out of people and of promise--a third of our counties lost population in
         the sixties.</p>
      <p>The violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan
         complexes are the most conspicuous area of failure in American life
         today.</p>
      <p>I propose that before these problems become insoluble, the Nation
         develop a national growth policy.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In the future, government decisions as to where to build highways,
            locate airports, acquire land, or sell land should be made with a clear
            objective of aiding a balanced growth for America.</span></p>
      <p>In particular, the Federal Government must be in a position to assist in
         the building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones.</p>
      <p>At the same time, we will carry our concern with the quality of life in
         America to the farm as well as the suburb, to the village as well as to
         the city. What rural America needs most is a new kind of assistance. It
         needs to be dealt with, not as a separate nation, but as part of an
         overall growth policy for America. We must create a new rural
         environment which will not only stem the migration to urban centers, but
         reverse it. If we seize our growth as a challenge, we can make the
         1970's an historic period when by conscious choice we transformed our
         land into what we want it to become.</p>
      <p>America, which has pioneered in the new abundance, and in the new
         technology, is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns
         which have followed in their wake--in turning the wonders of science to
         the service of man.</p>
      <p>In the majesty of this great Chamber we hear the echoes of America's
         history, of debates that rocked the Union and those that repaired it, of
         the summons to war and the search for peace, of the uniting of the
         people, the building of a nation.</p>
      <p>Those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths.</p>
      <p>They remind us also of that special genius of American democracy, which
         at one critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new
         road to the future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it.</p>
      <p>As I look down that new road which I have tried to map out today, I see
         a new America as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I see an America in which we have abolished hunger,</span> provided the means
         for every family in the Nation to obtain a minimum income, made enormous
         progress in providing better housing, faster transportation, improved
         health, and superior education.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I see an America in which we have checked inflation,</span> and waged a winning
         war against crime.</p>
      <p>I see an America in which we have made great strides in stopping the
         pollution of our air, cleaning up our water, opening up our parks,
         continuing to explore in space.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Most important, I see an America at peace with all the nations of the
            world.</span></p>
      <p>This is not an impossible dream. These goals are all within our reach.</p>
      <p>In times past, our forefathers had the vision but not the means to
         achieve such goals.</p>
      <p>Let it not be recorded that we were the first American generation that
         had the means but not the vision to make this dream come true.</p>
      <p>But let us, above all, recognize a fundamental truth. We can be the best
         clothed, best fed, best housed people in the world, enjoying clean air,
         clean water, beautiful parks, but we could still be the unhappiest
         people in the world without an indefinable spirit--the lift of a driving
         dream which has made America, from its beginning, the hope of the world.</p>
      <p>Two hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people, <span class="war">weak
            militarily</span>, <span class="economy">poor economically.</span> But America meant something to the world
         then which could not be measured in dollars, something far more
         important than military might.</p>
      <p>Listen to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802: We act not "for ourselves
         alone, but for the whole human race."</p>
      <p>We had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions
         of people in the world.</p>
      <p>Today, when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world, let it
         not be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made
         us the hope of the world at the time of our birth.</p>
      <p>The demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776.</p>
      <p>It is no longer enough to live and let live. Now we must live and help
         live.</p>
      <p>We need a fresh climate in America, one in which a person can breathe
         freely and breathe in freedom.</p>
      <p>Our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same
         thing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria.</p>
      <p>Even more than the programs I have described today, what this Nation
         needs is an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual
         and moral leadership which no programs for material progress can
         satisfy.</p>
      <p>Above all, let us inspire young Americans with a sense of excitement, a
         sense of destiny, a sense of involvement, in meeting the challenges we
         face in this great period of our history. Only then are they going to
         have any sense of satisfaction in their lives.</p>
      <p>The greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause
         bigger than himself. We have such a cause.</p>
      <p>How we seize the opportunities I have described today will determine not
         only our future, but the future of peace and freedom in this world in
         the last third of the century.</p>
      <p>May God give us the wisdom, the strength and, above all, the idealism to
         be worthy of that challenge, so that America can fulfill its destiny of
         being the world's best hope for liberty, for opportunity, for progress
         and peace for all peoples.

      <h3>January 22, 1971</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our
         distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>As this 92d Congress begins its session, America has lost a great
         Senator, and all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a
         loyal friend. I had the privilege of visiting Senator Russell in the
         hospital just a few days before he died. He never spoke about himself.
         He only spoke eloquently about the need for a strong national defense.
         In tribute to one of the most magnificent Americans of all time, I
         respectfully ask that all those here will rise in silent prayer for
         Senator Russell.</p>
      <p>Thank you.</p>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal address, I want to use this
         opportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather
         spirited contest for leadership positions in the House and the Senate
         and, also, to express my condolences to the losers. I know how both of
         you feel.</p>
      <p>And I particularly want to join with all of the Members of the House and
         the Senate as well in congratulating the new Speaker of the United
         States Congress.</p>
      <p>To those new Members of this House who may have some doubts about the
         possibilities for advancement in the years ahead, I would remind you
         that the Speaker and I met just 24 years ago in this Chamber as freshmen
         Members of the 80th Congress. As you see, we both have come up in the
         world a bit since then.</p>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, this 92d Congress has a chance to be recorded as the
         greatest Congress in America's history.</p>
      <p>In these troubled years just past, America has been going through a long
         nightmare of war and division, of crime and inflation. Even more deeply,
         we have gone through a long, dark night of the American spirit. But now
         that night is ending. Now we must let our spirits soar again. Now we are
         ready for the lift of a driving dream.</p>
      <p>The people of this Nation are eager to get on with the quest for new
         greatness. They see challenges, and they are prepared to meet those
         challenges. It is for us here to open the doors that will set free again
         the real greatness of this Nation--the genius of the American people.</p>
      <p>How shall we meet this challenge? How can we truly open the doors, and
         set free the full genius of our people?</p>
      <p>The way in which the 92d Congress answers these questions will determine
         its place in history. More importantly, it can determine this Nation's
         place in history as we enter the third century of our independence.</p>
      <p>Tonight I shall present to the Congress six great goals. I shall ask not
         simply for more new programs in the old framework. I shall ask to change
         the framework of government itself---to reform the entire structure of
         American government so we can make it again fully responsive to the
         needs and the wishes of the American people.</p>
      <p>If we act boldly--if we seize this moment and achieve these goals--we
         can close the gap between promise and performance in American
         government. We can bring together the resources of this Nation and the
         spirit of the American people.</p>
      <p>In discussing these great goals, I shall deal tonight only with matters
         on the domestic side of the Nation's agenda. I shall make a separate
         report to the Congress and the Nation next month on developments in
         foreign policy.</p>
      <p>The first of these great goals is already before the Congress.</p>
      <p>I urge that the unfinished business of the 91st Congress be made the
         first priority business of the 92d Congress.</p>
      <p>Over the next 2 weeks, I will call upon Congress to take action on more
         than 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed
         last year.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The most important is welfare reform.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The present welfare system has become a monstrous, consuming outrage--an
            outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularly
            against the children it is supposed to help.</span></p>
      <p>We may honestly disagree, as we do, on what to do about it.<span class="economy"> But we can
            all agree that we must meet the challenge, not by pouring more money
            into a bad program, but by abolishing the present welfare system and
            adopting a new one.</span></p>
      <p>S<span class="economy">o let us place a floor under the income of every family with children
            in America--and without those demeaning, soul-stifling affronts to human
            dignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today. But let us
            also establish an effective work incentive and an effective work
            requirement.</span></p>
      <p>Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves. This shall
         be our goal.</p>
      <p>Let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves. But
         let us stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to
         do so.</p>
      <p>The second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed
         since 1957--full prosperity in peacetime.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The tide of inflation has turned. The rise in the cost of living, which
            had been gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties, was reduced
            last year. Inflation will be further reduced this year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">But as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price
            stability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime
            economy to a peacetime economy, we have paid a price in increased
            unemployment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment
            in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than
            in any peacetime year of the sixties.</span></p>
      <p>This is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies.
         We must do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To achieve this, I will submit an expansionary budget this year--one
            that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job
            opportunities for millions of Americans</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">It will be a full employment budget, a budget designed to be in balance
            if the economy were operating at its peak potential. By spending as if
            we were at full employment, we will help to bring about full employment.</span></p>
      <p>I ask the Congress to accept these expansionary policies--to accept the
         concept of a full employment budget. At the same time, I ask the
         Congress to cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the
         limits of the full employment budget. For as we wage a campaign to bring
         about a widely shared prosperity, we must not reignite the fires of
         inflation and so undermine that prosperity.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">With the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget, with
            the commitment of the independent Federal Reserve System to provide
            fully for the monetary needs of a growing economy, and with a much
            greater effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage
            and price decisions in the light of the national interest and their own
            self-interest--then for the worker, the farmer, the consumer, for
            Americans everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity: more
            jobs, more income, more profits, without inflation and<span class="war"> without war.</span></span></p>
      <p>This is a great goal, and one that we can achieve together.</p>
      <p>The third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun
         last year: to restore and enhance our natural environment.</p>
      <p>Building on the foundation laid in the 37-point program that I submitted
         to Congress last year, I will propose a strong new set of initiatives to
         clean up our air and water, to combat noise, and to preserve and restore
         our surroundings.</p>
      <p>I will propose programs to make better use of our land, to encourage a
         balanced national growth--growth that will revitalize our rural
         heartland and enhance the quality of life in America.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">And not only to meet today's needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow,
            I will put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a
            President of the United States to expand the Nation's parks, recreation
            areas, open spaces, in a way that truly brings parks to the people where
            the people are. For only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next
            generation have parks to enjoy</span>.</p>
      <p>As a fourth great goal, I will offer a far-reaching set of proposals for
         improving America's health care and making it available more fairly to
         more people.</p>
      <p>I will propose:</p>
      <p>--A program to insure that no American family will be prevented from
         obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay.</p>
      <p>--I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical
         schools, to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health
         personnel.</p>
      <p>--Incentives to improve the delivery of health services, to get more
         medical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately
         served, to make greater use of medical assistants, and to slow the
         alarming rise in the costs of medical care.</p>
      <p>--New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking the
         causes of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors to
         keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick.</p>
      <p>I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch
         an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later
         for whatever additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come
         in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom
         and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread
         disease. Let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">America has long been the wealthiest nation in the world.</span> Now it is time
         we became the healthiest nation in the world.</p>
      <p>The fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our State and local
         governments.</p>
      <p>As we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976, we remember that this
         Nation launched itself as a loose confederation of separate States,
         without a workable central government. At that time, the mark of its
         leaders' vision was that they quickly saw the need to balance the
         separate powers of the States with a government of central powers.</p>
      <p>And so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers, of unity with
         diversity--and so clear was their vision that it survives today as the
         oldest written constitution still in force in the world.</p>
      <p>For almost two centuries since--and dramatically in the 1930's--at those
         great turning points when the question has been between the States and
         the Federal Government, that question has been resolved in favor of a
         stronger central Federal Government.</p>
      <p>During this time the Nation grew and the Nation prospered. But one thing
         history tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction
         forever. Nations change, they adapt, or they slowly die.</p>
      <p>The time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and
         resources from the States and communities to Washington, and start power
         and resources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities
         and, more important, to the people all across America.</p>
      <p>The time has come for a new partnership between the Federal Government
         and the States and localities--a partnership in which we entrust the
         States and localities with a larger share of the Nation's
         responsibilities, and in which we share our Federal revenues with them
         so that they can meet those responsibilities.</p>
      <p>To achieve this goal, I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact a
         plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept.</p>
      <p>All across America today, States and cities are confronted with a
         financial crisis. Some have already been cutting back on essential
         services---for example, just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back
         on trash collections. Most are caught between the prospects of
         bankruptcy on the one hand and adding to an already crushing tax burden
         on the other.</p>
      <p>As one indication of the rising costs of local government, I discovered
         the other day that my home town of Whittier, California--which has a
         population of 67,000--has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire
         Federal budget was in 1791.</p>
      <p>Now the time has come to take a new direction, and once again to
         introduce a new and more creative balance to our approach to government.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">So let us put the money where the needs are. And let us put the power to
            spend it where the people are.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I propose that the Congress make a $16 billion investment in renewing
            State and local government. Five billion dollars of this will be in new
            and unrestricted funds to be used as the States and localities see fit.
            The other $11 billion will be provided by allocating $1 billion of new
            funds and converting one-third of the money going to the present
            narrow-purpose aid programs into Federal revenue sharing funds for six
            broad purposes--for urban development, rural development, education,
            transportation, job training, and law enforcement--but with the States
            and localities making their own decisions on how it should be spent
            within each category.</span></p>
      <p>For the next fiscal year, this would increase total Federal aid to the
         States and localities more than 25 percent over the present level.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The revenue sharing proposals I send to the Congress will include the
            safeguards against discrimination that accompany all other Federal funds
            allocated to the States. Neither the President nor the Congress nor the
            conscience of this Nation can permit money which comes from all the
            people to be used in a way which discriminates against some of the
            people.</span></p>
      <p>The Federal Government will still have a large and vital role to play in
         achieving our national progress. Established functions that are clearly
         and essentially Federal in nature will still be performed by the Federal
         Government. New functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the
         Federal Government--such as those I have urged tonight in welfare and
         health--will be added to the Federal agenda. Whenever it makes the best
         sense for us to act as a whole nation, the Federal Government should and
         will lead the way. But where States or local governments can better do
         what needs to be done, let us see that they have the resources to do it
         there.</p>
      <p>Under this plan, the Federal Government will provide the States and
         localities with more money and less interference--and by cutting down
         the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further.</p>
      <p>Let us share our resources.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let us share them to rescue the States and localities from the brink of
            financial crisis.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape
            from ever-higher property taxes and sales taxes</span>.</p>
      <p>Let us share our resources for two other reasons as well.</p>
      <p>The first of these reasons has to do with government itself, and the
         second has to do with each of us, with the individual.</p>
      <p>Let's face it. Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at
         all levels. They will not--and they should not--continue to tolerate the
         gap between promise and performance in government.</p>
      <p>The fact is that we have made the Federal Government so strong it grows
         muscle-bound and the States and localities so weak they approach
         impotence.</p>
      <p>If we put more power in more places, we can make government more
         creative in more places. That way we multiply the number of people with
         the ability to make things happen--and we can open the way to a new
         burst of creative energy throughout America.</p>
      <p>The final reason I urge this historic shift is much more personal, for
         each and for every one of us.</p>
      <p>As everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in America, as
         the forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more
         impersonal, a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land.</p>
      <p>Whether it is the workingman who feels neglected, <span class="civil-rights">the black man who
            feels oppressed,</span> or the mother concerned about her children, there has
         been a growing feeling that "Things are in the saddle, and ride
         mankind."</p>
      <p>Millions of frustrated young Americans today are crying out--asking not
         what will government do for me, but what can I do, how can I contribute,
         how can I matter?</p>
      <p>And so let us answer them. Let us say to them and let us say to all
         Americans, "We hear you. We will give you a chance. We are going to give
         you a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect
         your future--a chance to participate in government--because we are going
         to provide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference
         that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole
         community."</p>
      <p>The further away government is from people, the stronger government
         becomes and the weaker people become. And a nation with a strong
         government and a weak people is an empty shell.</p>
      <p>I reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., is
         inevitably more wise, more honest, and more efficient than government at
         the local or State level. The honesty and efficiency of government
         depends on people. Government at all levels has good people and bad
         people. And the way to get more good people into government is to give
         them more opportunity to do good things.</p>
      <p>The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is best
         for people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is
         really a contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves.
         This notion is completely foreign to the American experience. Local
         government is the government closest to the people, it is most
         responsive to the individual person. It is people's government in a far
         more intimate way than the Government in Washington can ever be.</p>
      <p>People came to America because they wanted to determine their own future
         rather than to live in a country where others determined their future
         for them.</p>
      <p>What this change means is that once again in America we are placing our
         trust in people.</p>
      <p>I have faith in people. I trust the judgment of people. Let us give the
         people of America a chance, a bigger voice in deciding for themselves
         those questions that so greatly affect their lives.</p>
      <p>The sixth great goal is a complete reform of the Federal Government
         itself.</p>
      <p>Based on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best advice
         obtainable, I have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of the
         executive branch is needed if the Government is to keep up with the
         times and with the needs of the people.</p>
      <p>I propose, therefore, that we reduce the present 12 Cabinet Departments
         to eight.</p>
      <p>I propose that the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, and Justice
         remain, but that all the other departments be consolidated into four:
         Human Resources, Community Development, Natural Resources, and Economic
         Development.</p>
      <p>Let us look at what these would be:</p>
      <p>--First, a department dealing with the concerns of people--as
         individuals, as members of a family--a department focused on human
         needs.</p>
      <p>--Second, a department concerned with the community--rural communities
         and urban communities--and with all that it takes to make a community
         function as a community.</p>
      <p>--Third, a department concerned with our physical environment, with the
         preservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which
         our Nation depends.</p>
      <p>--<span class="economy">And fourth, a department concerned with our prosperity--with our jobs,
            our businesses, and those many activities that keep our economy running
            smoothly and well.</span></p>
      <p>Under this plan, rather than dividing up our departments by narrow
         subjects, we would organize them around the great purposes of
         government. Rather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels
         of bureaucracy, we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for
         getting problems solved.</p>
      <p>With these four departments, when we have a problem we will know where
         to go--and the department will have the authority and the resources to
         do something about it.</p>
      <p>Over the years we have added departments and created agencies at the
         Federal level, each to serve a new constituency, to handle a particular
         task--and these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopeless
         confusion of form and function.</p>
      <p>The time has come to match our structure to our purposes---to look with
         a fresh eye, to organize the Government by conscious, comprehensive
         design to meet the new needs of a new era.</p>
      <p>One hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln stood on a battlefield and spoke
         of a "government of the people, by the people, for the people." Too
         often since then, we have become a nation of the Government, by the
         Government, for the Government.</p>
      <p>By enacting these reforms, we can renew that principle that Lincoln
         stated so simply and so well.</p>
      <p>By giving everyone's voice a chance to be heard, we will have government
         that truly is of the people.</p>
      <p>By creating more centers of meaningful power, more places where
         decisions that really count can be made, by giving more people a chance
         to do something, we can have government that truly is by the people.</p>
      <p>And by setting up a completely modern, functional system of government
         at the national level, we in Washington will at last be able to provide
         government that is truly for the people.</p>
      <p>I realize that what I am asking is that not only the executive branch in
         Washington but that even this Congress will have to change by giving up
         some of its power.</p>
      <p>Change is hard. But without change there can be no progress. And for
         each of us the question then becomes, not "Will change cause me
         inconvenience?" but "Will change bring progress for America?"</p>
      <p>Giving up power is hard. But I would urge all of you, as leaders of this
         country, to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are
         those who gave power to people, and not those who took it away.</p>
      <p>As we consider these reforms we will be acting, not for the next 2 years
         or for the next 10 years, but for the next 100 years.</p>
      <p>So let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this
         moment in history but also of history itself.</p>
      <p>Let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the
         boldness and the courage of those great Americans who met in
         Philadelphia almost 190 years ago to write a constitution.</p>
      <p>Let us leave a heritage as they did--not just for our children but for
         millions yet unborn--of a nation where every American will have a chance
         not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to
         participate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes
         but his ideas count--a system of government which will provide the means
         for America to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before.</p>
      <p>Those men who met at Philadelphia left a great heritage because they had
         a vision--not only of what the Nation was but of what it could become.</p>
      <p>As I think of that vision, I recall that America was founded as the land
         of the open door--as a haven for the oppressed, a land of opportunity, a
         place of refuge, of hope.</p>
      <p>When the first settlers opened the door of America three and a half
         centuries ago, they came to escape persecution and to find
         opportunity--and they left wide the door of welcome for others to
         follow.</p>
      <p>When the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence almost two
         centuries ago, they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of
         human fulfillment--not just for an elite but for all.</p>
      <p>To the generations that followed, America's was the open door that
         beckoned millions from the old world to the new in search of a better
         life, a freer life, a fuller life, and in which, by their own decisions,
         they could shape their own destinies.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">For the black American, the Indian, the Mexican-American, and for those
            others in our land who have not had an equal chance, the Nation at last
            has begun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal
            opportunity, and of human dignity.</span></p>
      <p>For all Americans, with these changes I have proposed tonight we can
         open the door to a new era of opportunity. We can open the door to full
         and effective participation in the decisions that affect their lives. We
         can open the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels,
         between those governments and the people themselves. And by so doing, we
         can open wide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here
         in America now and in the years to come.</p>
      <p>In the next few weeks I will spell out in greater detail the way I
         propose that we achieve these six great goals. I ask this Congress to be
         responsive. If it is, then the 92d Congress, your Congress, our
         Congress, at the end of its term, will be able to look back on a record
         more splendid than any in our history.</p>
      <p>This can be the Congress that helped us end the longest war in the
         Nation's history, and end it in a way that will give us at last a
         genuine chance to enjoy what we have not had in this century: a full
         generation of peace.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy, with
            full employment and without inflation</span>--<span class="war">and without the deadly stimulus
            of war.</span></p>
      <p>This can be the Congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed
         recipients of their dignity and robbed States and cities of their
         resources.</p>
      <p>This can be the Congress that pressed forward the rescue of our
         environment, and established for the next generation an enduring legacy
         of parks for the people.</p>
      <p>This can be the Congress that launched a new era in American medicine,
         in which the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were
         made less burdensome.</p>
      <p>But above all, what this Congress can be remembered for is opening the
         way to a new American revolution--a peaceful revolution in which power
         was turned back to the people--in which government at all levels was
         refreshed and renewed and made truly responsive. This can be a
         revolution as profound, as far-reaching, as exciting as that first
         revolution almost 200 years ago--and it can mean that just 5 years from
         now America will enter its third century as a young nation new in
         spirit, with all the vigor and the freshness with which it began its
         first century.</p>
      <p>My colleagues in the Congress, these are great goals. They can make the
         sessions of this Congress a great moment for America. So let us pledge
         together to go forward together--by achieving these goals to give
         America the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the
         years to come, and in so doing to make this the greatest Congress in the
         history of this great and good country.
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_20,_1972" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>Richard Nixon</h2>
      <h3>January 20, 1972</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our
         distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>Twenty-five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman--along with
         Speaker Albert--and listened for the first time to the President address
         the State of the Union.</p>
      <p>I shall never forget that moment. The Senate, the diplomatic corps, the
         Supreme Court, the Cabinet entered the Chamber, and then the President
         of the United States. As all of you are aware, I had some differences
         with President Truman. He had some with me. But I remember that on that
         day--the day he addressed that joint session of the newly elected
         Republican 80th Congress, he spoke not as a partisan, but as President
         of all the people--calling upon the Congress to put aside partisan
         considerations in the national interest.</p>
      <p>The Greek-Turkish aid program, the Marshall Plan, the great foreign
         policy initiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war
         for over 25 years were approved by the 80th Congress, by a bipartisan
         majority of which I was proud to be a part.</p>
      <p>Nineteen hundred seventy-two is now before us. It holds precious time in
         which to accomplish good for the Nation. We must not waste it. I know
         the political pressures in this session of the Congress will be great.
         There are more candidates for the Presidency in this Chamber today than
         there probably have been at any one time in the whole history of the
         Republic. And there is an honest difference of opinion, not only between
         the parties, but within each party, on some foreign policy issues and on
         some domestic policy issues.</p>
      <p>However, there are great national problems that are so vital that they
         transcend partisanship. So let us have our debates. Let us have our
         honest differences. But let us join in keeping the national interest
         first. Let us join in making sure that legislation the Nation needs does
         not become hostage to the political interests of any party or any
         person.</p>
      <p>There is ample precedent, in this election year, for me to present you
         with a huge list of new proposals, knowing full well that there would
         not be any possibility of your passing them if you worked night and day.</p>
      <p>I shall not do that.</p>
      <p>I have presented to the leaders of the Congress today a message of
         15,000 words discussing in some detail where the Nation stands and
         setting forth specific legislative items on which I have asked the
         Congress to act. Much of this is legislation which I proposed in 1969,
         in 1970, and also in the first session of this 92d Congress and on which
         I feel it is essential that action be completed this year.</p>
      <p>I am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope
         of passage. I am presenting only vital programs which are within the
         capacity of this Congress to enact, within the capacity of the budget to
         finance, and which I believe should be above partisanship--programs
         which deal with urgent priorities for the Nation, which should and must
         be the subject of bipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of
         the country in 1972.</p>
      <p>When I took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3
         years ago today, the Nation was ending one of the most tortured decades
         in its history.</p>
      <p>The 1960's were a time of great progress in many areas. <span class="war">But as we all
            know, they were also times of great agony--the agonies of war,</span> <span class="economy">of
            inflation,</span> of rapidly rising crime, of deteriorating titles, of hopes
         raised and disappointed, and of anger and frustration that led finally
         to violence and to the worst civil disorder in a century.</p>
      <p>I recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame. The Nation
         was so torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both
         parties questioned whether America could be governed at all.</p>
      <p>The Nation has made significant progress in these first years of the
         seventies:</p>
      <p>Our cities are no longer engulfed by civil disorders.</p>
      <p>Our colleges and universities have again become places of learning
         instead of battlegrounds.</p>
      <p>A beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment.</p>
      <p>The rate of increase in crime has been slowed--and here in the District
         of Columbia, the one city where the Federal Government has direct
         jurisdiction, serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent
         from the year before.</p>
      <p>Most important, because of the beginnings that have been made, we can
         say today that this year 1972 can be the year in which America may make
         the greatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at
         peace with all the nations of the world.</p>
      <p>As our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end, we must now go
         on to build a generation of peace.</p>
      <p><span class="war">To achieve that goal, we must first face realistically the need to
            maintain our defense.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the past 3 years, we have reduced the burden of arms. For the first
            time in 20 years, spending on defense has been brought below spending on
            human resources.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">As we look to the future, we find encouraging progress in our
            negotiations with the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms. And
            looking further into the future, we hope there can eventually be
            agreement on the mutual reduction of arms.</span> <span class="war">But until there is such a
            mutual agreement, we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And that is why, because of rising research and development costs,
            because of increases in military and civilian pay, because of the need
            to proceed with new weapons systems, my budget for the coming fiscal
            year will provide for an increase in defense spending.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace; they are the
            guardians of peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">There could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would
            tempt others by weakening America, and thereby endanger the peace of the
            world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In our foreign policy, we have entered a new era.</span> The world has changed
         greatly in the 11 years since President John Kennedy said in his
         Inaugural Address, "... we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet
         any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival
         and the success of liberty."</p>
      <p>Our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new
         realities of the new world we live in. We make today only those
         commitments we are able and prepared to meet.</p>
      <p>Our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable. But others must
         bear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world.</p>
      <p>And so this, then, is our policy:</p>
      <p><span class="war">--We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to
            the security of the United States or of our allies</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--We will help other nations develop the capability of defending
            themselves.</span></p>
      <p>--We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments.</p>
      <p>--We will act to defend our interests, whenever and wherever they are
         threatened anyplace in the world.</p>
      <p>--But where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved,
         our role will be limited.</p>
      <p><span class="war">--We will not intervene militarily.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">--But we will use our influence to prevent war.</span></p>
      <p>--If war comes, we will use our influence to stop it.</p>
      <p>--Once it is over, we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds
         of those who have participated in it.</p>
      <p>As you know, I will soon be visiting the People's Republic of China and
         the Soviet Union. I go there with no illusions. We have great
         differences with both powers. We shall continue to have great
         differences. But peace depends on the ability of great powers to live
         together on the same planet despite their differences.</p>
      <p>We would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we
         failed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that
         we will be able to talk about those differences, rather than to fight
         about them, in the future.</p>
      <p>As we look back over this century, let us, in the highest spirit of
         bipartisanship, recognize that we can be proud of our Nation's record in
         foreign affairs.</p>
      <p>America has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom,
         preserving peace, alleviating human suffering around the globe, than any
         nation has ever done in the history of man.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We have fought four wars in this century, but our power has never been
            used to break the peace, only to keep it; never been used to destroy
            freedom, only to defend it. We now have within our reach the goal of
            insuring that the next generation can be the first generation in this
            century to be spared the scourges of war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Turning to our problems at home, we are making progress toward our goal
            of a new prosperity without war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Industrial production, consumer spending, retail sales, personal income
            all have been rising. Total employment, real income are the highest in
            history. New home building starts this past year reached the highest
            level ever. Business and consumer confidence have both been rising.
            Interest rates are down. The rate of inflation is down. We can look with
            confidence to 1972 as the year when the back of inflation will be
            broken.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, this a good record, but it is not good enough--not when we still
            have an unemployment rate of 6 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">It is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early
            peacetime years of the sixties, or that if the more than 2 million men
            released from the Armed Forces and defense-related industries were still
            in their wartime jobs, unemployment would be far lower.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime. We intend to
            meet that goal, and we can.</span></p>
      <p>The Congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job-creating
         tax program last month.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The historic monetary agreements, agreements that we have reached with
            the major European nations, Canada, and Japan, will help meet it by
            providing new markets for American products, new jobs for American
            workers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being
            inflationary--a job-producing budget that will help take up the gap as
            the economy expands to full employment.</span></p>
      <p>Our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to
         revitalize rural America, by giving to America's farmers their fair
         share of America's increasing productivity.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a
            set of major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America's
            great capacity for technological advance, and to direct it toward
            improving the quality of life for every American</span>.</p>
      <p>In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology
         is capable of achieving. Now the time has come to move more deliberately
         toward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing
         the wonders of science to the service of man.</p>
      <p>I shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new
         program of Federal partnership in technological research and
         development--with Federal incentives to increase private research,
         federally supported research on projects designed to improve our
         everyday lives in ways that will range from improving mass transit to
         developing new systems of emergency health care that could save
         thousands of lives annually.</p>
      <p>Historically, our superior technology and high productivity have made it
         possible for American workers to be the highest paid in the world by
         far, and yet for our goods still to compete in world markets.</p>
      <p>Now we face a new situation. <span class="infra">As other nations move rapidly forward in
            technology, the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall
            around America, but rather to remain competitive by improving our own
            technology still further and by increasing productivity in American
            industry.</span></p>
      <p>Our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for American
         goods to compete fairly in the world's markets--but they still must
         compete. The new technology program will put to use the skills of many
         highly trained Americans, skills that might otherwise be wasted. It will
         also meet the growing technological challenge from abroad, and it will
         thus help to create new industries, as well as creating more jobs for
         America's workers in producing for the world's markets.</p>
      <p>This second session of the 92d Congress already has before it more than
         90 major Administration proposals which still await action.</p>
      <p>I have discussed these in the extensive written message that I have
         presented to the Congress today.</p>
      <p>They include, among others, our programs to improve life for the aging;
         to combat crime and drug abuse; to improve health services and to ensure
         that no one will be denied needed health care because of inability to
         pay; to protect workers' pension rights; to promote equal opportunity
         for members of minorities, and others who have been left behind; to
         expand consumer protection; to improve the environment; to revitalize
         rural America; to help the cities; to launch new initiatives in
         education; to improve transportation, and to put an end to costly labor
         tie-ups in transportation.</p>
      <p>The west coast dock strike is a case in point. This Nation cannot and
         will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie-up in the future.</p>
      <p>The messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our
         structure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead.</p>
      <p>They include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare
         system--substitution of a new system that provides work requirements and
         work incentives for those who can help themselves, income support for
         those who cannot help themselves, and fairness to the working poor.</p>
      <p>They include a $17 billion program of Federal revenue sharing with the
         States and localities as an investment in their renewal, an investment
         also of faith in the American people.</p>
      <p>They also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of
         the Federal Government so that it will be more efficient, more
         responsive, and able to meet the challenges of the decades ahead.</p>
      <p>One year ago, standing in this place, I laid before the opening session
         of this Congress six great goals. One of these was welfare reform. That
         proposal has been before the Congress now for nearly 2 1/2 years.</p>
      <p>My proposals on revenue sharing, government reorganization, health care,
         and the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year.
         Many of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been here
         that long or longer.</p>
      <p>Now, 1971, we can say, was a year of consideration of these measures.
         Now let us join in making 1972 a year of action on them, action by the
         Congress, for the Nation and for the people of America.</p>
      <p>Now, in addition, there is one pressing need which I have not previously
         covered, but which must be placed on the national agenda.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We long have looked in this Nation to the local property tax as the main
            source of financing for public primary and secondary education.</span></p>
      <p>As a result, soaring school costs, soaring property tax rates now
         threaten both our communities and our schools. They threaten communities
         because property taxes, which more than doubled in the 10 years from
         1960 to '70, have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory
         of all taxes, hitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired; and
         they threaten schools, as hard-pressed voters understandably reject new
         bond issues at the polls.</p>
      <p>The problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court
         decisions, which have held that the conventional method of financing
         schools through local property taxes is discriminatory and
         unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>Nearly 2 years ago, I named a special Presidential commission to study
         the problems of school finance, and I also directed the Federal
         departments to look into the same problems. We are developing
         comprehensive proposals to meet these problems.</p>
      <p>This issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems:
         support of the schools and the basic relationships of Federal, State,
         and local governments in any tax reforms.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury, we are carefully
         reviewing all of the tax aspects, and I have this week enlisted the
         Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in addressing the
         intergovernmental relations aspects.</p>
      <p>I have asked this bipartisan Commission to review our proposals for
         Federal action to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and
         property taxes. Later in the year, when both Commissions have completed
         their studies, I shall make my final recommendations for relieving the
         burden of property taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing
         for our children's education.</p>
      <p>These recommendations will be revolutionary. But all these
         recommendations, however, will be rooted in one fundamental principle
         with which there can be no compromise: Local school boards must have
         control over local schools.</p>
      <p>As we look ahead over the coming decades, vast new growth and change are
         not only certainties, they will be the dominant reality of this world,
         and particularly of our life in America.</p>
      <p>Surveying the certainty of rapid change, we can be like a fallen rider
         caught in the stirrups--or we can sit high in the saddle, the masters of
         change, directing it on a course we choose.</p>
      <p>The secret of mastering change in today's world is to reach back to old
         and proven principles, and to adapt them with imagination and
         intelligence to the new realities of a new age.</p>
      <p>That is what we have done in the proposals that I have laid before the
         Congress. They are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as
         human nature, as robust as the American experience; and they are
         responsive to new conditions. Thus they represent a spirit of change
         that is truly renewal.</p>
      <p>As we look back at those old principles, we find them as timely as they
         are timeless.</p>
      <p>We believe in independence, and self-reliance, and the creative value of
         the competitive spirit.</p>
      <p>We believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in the
         protection of individual rights and liberties.</p>
      <p>We believe in the family as the keystone of the community, and in the
         community as the keystone of the Nation.</p>
      <p>We believe in compassion toward those in need.</p>
      <p>We believe in a system of law, justice, and order as the basis of a
         genuinely free society.</p>
      <p>We believe that a person should get what he works for--and that those
         who can, should work for what they get.</p>
      <p>We believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in
         their own lives, in their own communities--and we believe in their right
         to make those decisions.</p>
      <p>In applying these principles, we have done so with the full
         understanding that what we seek in the seventies, what our quest is, is
         not merely for more, but for better for a better quality of life for all
         Americans.</p>
      <p>Thus, for example, we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning
         up our air and water, making our surroundings more attractive. We are
         providing broader support for the arts, helping stimulate a deeper
         appreciation of what they can contribute to the Nation's activities and
         to our individual lives.</p>
      <p>But nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way
         we treat one another, than our capacity to live respectfully together as
         a unified society, with a full, generous regard for the rights of others
         and also for the feelings of others.</p>
      <p>As we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years, as we learn
         once again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another,
         we are regaining that capacity.</p>
      <p>As is customary here, on this occasion, I have been talking about
         programs. Programs are important. But even more important than programs
         is what we are as a Nation--what we mean as a Nation, to ourselves and
         to the world.</p>
      <p>In New York Harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the
         world--the Statue of Liberty, the gift in 1886 of the people of France
         to the people of the United States. This statue is more than a landmark;
         it is a symbol--a symbol of what America has meant to the world.</p>
      <p>It reminds us that what America has meant is not its wealth, and not its
         power, but its spirit and purpose--a land that enshrines liberty and
         opportunity, and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in
         search of a better and a fuller and, above all, a freer life.</p>
      <p>The world's hopes poured into America, along with its people. And those
         hopes, those dreams, that have been brought here from every corner of
         the world, have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the
         world.</p>
      <p>Four years from now, America will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its
         founding as a Nation. There are those who say that the old Spirit of '76
         is dead--that we no longer have the strength of character, the idealism,
         the faith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents.</p>
      <p>Those who say this do not know America.</p>
      <p>We have been undergoing self-doubts and self-criticism. But these are
         only the other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of
         want in the midst of plenty, of our impatience with the slowness with
         which age-old ills are being overcome.</p>
      <p>If we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society, or complacent
         about our institutions, or blind to the lingering inequities--then we
         would have lost our way.</p>
      <p>But the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals,
         deep down, are still strong. Indeed, they remind us that what is really
         best about America is its compassion. They remind us that in the final
         analysis, America is great not because it is strong, not because it is
         rich, but because this is a good country.</p>
      <p>Let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are
         evil because we are not yet perfect, that we are corrupt because we are
         not yet pure, that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have gone
         into the building of America were for naught because the building is not
         yet done.</p>
      <p>Let us see that the path we are traveling is wide, with room in it for
         all of us, and that its direction is toward a better Nation and a more
         peaceful world.</p>
      <p>Never has it mattered more that we go forward together.</p>
      <p>Look at this Chamber. The leadership of America is here today--the
         Supreme Court, the Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>Together, we hold the future of the Nation, and the conscience of the
         Nation in our hands.</p>
      <p>Because this year is an election year, it will be a time of great
         pressure.</p>
      <p>If we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the
         historic challenges that we face, we will have failed the trust of
         millions of Americans and shaken the confidence they have a right to
         place in us, in their Government.</p>
      <p>Never has a Congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a
         profound and constructive reform for the Nation than this Congress.</p>
      <p>If we succeed in these tasks, there will be credit enough for all--not
         only for doing what is right, but doing it in the right way, by rising
         above partisan interest to serve the national interest.</p>
      <p>And if we fail, more than any one of us, America will be the loser.</p>
      <p>That is why my call upon the Congress today is for a high statesmanship,
         so that in the years to come Americans will look back and say because it
         withstood the intense pressures of a political year, and achieved such
         great good for the American people and for the future of this Nation,
         this was truly a great Congress.
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idFebruary_2,_1973" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>Richard Nixon</h2>
      <h3>February 2, 1973</h3>
      <p>To the Congress of the United States:</p>
      <p>The traditional form of the President's annual report giving "to the
         Congress Information of the State of the Union" is a single message or
         address. As the affairs and concerns of our Union have multiplied over
         the years, however, so too have the subjects that require discussion in
         State of the Union Messages.</p>
      <p>This year in particular, with so many changes in Government programs
         under consideration--and with our very philosophy about the relationship
         between the individual and the State at an historic crossroads--a
         single, all-embracing State of the Union Message would not appear to be
         adequate.</p>
      <p>I have therefore decided to present my 1973 State of the Union report in
         the form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rd
         Congress. The purpose of this first message in the series is to give a
         concise overview of where we stand as a people today, and to outline
         some of the general goals that I believe we should pursue over the next
         year and beyond. In coming weeks, I will send to the Congress further
         State of the Union reports on specific areas of policy including
         economic affairs, natural resources, human resources, community
         development and foreign and defense policy.</p>
      <p>The new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach
         to Government: an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s,
         not those of the 1930s or of the 1960s. The role of the Federal
         Government as we approach our third century of independence should not
         be to dominate any facet of American life, but rather to aid and
         encourage people, communities and institutions to deal with as many of
         the difficulties and challenges facing them as possible, and to help see
         to it that every American has a full and equal opportunity to realize
         his or her potential.</p>
      <p>If we were to continue to expand the Federal Government at the rate of
         the past several decades, it soon would consume us entirely. The time
         has come when we must make clear choices--choices between old programs
         that set worthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that
         provide a better way to realize those goals; and choices, too, between
         competing programs--all of which may be desirable in themselves but only
         some of which we can afford with the finite resources at our command.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Because our resources are not infinite, we also face a critical choice
            in 1973 between holding the line in Government spending and adopting
            expensive programs which will surely force up taxes and refuel
            inflation.</span></p>
      <p>Finally, it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense of
         responsibility at the State and local level, and among individual
         Americans.</p>
      <p>WHERE WE STAND</p>
      <p>The basic state of our Union today is sound, and full of promise.</p>
      <p>We enter 1973 economically strong, militarily secure and, most important
         of all, at peace after a long and trying war.</p>
      <p>America continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more of
         its people than any other nation in the world. We have passed through
         one of the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering to
         despair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people.</p>
      <p>Looking back, there is a lesson in all this for all of us. The lesson is
         one that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years.
         But we did learn it. That lesson is that even potentially destructive
         forces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel
         them, and when we use common sense and common decency to create a
         climate of mutual respect and goodwill.</p>
      <p>By working together and harnessing the forces of nature, Americans have
         unlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe.</p>
      <p>Men have walked the surface of the moon and soared to new heights of
         discovery.</p>
      <p>This same spirit of discovery is helping us to conquer disease and
         suffering that have plagued our own planet since the dawn of time.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">By working together with the leaders of other nations, we have been able
            to build a new hope for lasting peace--for a structure of world order in
            which common interest outweighs old animosities,</span> and in which a new
         generation of the human family can grow up at peace in a changing world.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">At home, we have learned that by working together we can create
            prosperity without fanning inflation;</span> we can restore order without
         weakening freedom.</p>
      <p>THE CHALLENGES WE FACE</p>
      <p>These first years of the 1970s have been good years for America.</p>
      <p>Our job--all of us together--is to make 1973 and the years to come even
         better ones. I believe that we can. I believe that we can make the years
         leading to our Bicentennial the best four years in American history.</p>
      <p>But we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without
         the will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Hard decisions must be made, and we must stick by them.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the field of foreign policy, we must remember that a strong
            America--an America whose word is believed and whose strength is
            respected--is essential to continued peace and understanding in the
            world. The peace with honor we have achieved in Vietnam has strengthened
            this basic American credibility. We must act in such a way in coming
            years that this credibility will remain intact, and with it, the world
            stability of which it is so indispensable a part</span>.</p>
      <p>At home, we must reject the mistaken notion--a notion that has dominated
         too much of the public dialogue for too long--that ever bigger
         Government is the answer to every problem.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have learned only too well that heavy taxation and excessive
            Government spending are not a cure-all. In too many cases, instead of
            solving the problems they were aimed at, they have merely placed an ever
            heavier burden on the shoulders of the American taxpayer, in the form of
            higher taxes and a higher cost of living. At the same time they have
            deceived our people because many of the intended beneficiaries received
            far less than was promised,</span> thus undermining public faith in the
         effectiveness of Government as a whole.</p>
      <p>The time has come for us to draw the line. <span class="economy">The time has come for the
            responsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand against
            overgrown Government and for the American taxpayer. We are not spending
            the Federal Government's money, we are spending the taxpayer's money,
            and it must be spent in a way which guarantees his money's worth and
            yields the fullest possible benefit to the people being helped</span>.</p>
      <p>The answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes
         and more spending. It is less waste, more results and greater freedom
         for the individual American to earn a rightful place in his own
         community--and for States and localities to address their own needs in
         their own ways, in the light of their own priorities.</p>
      <p>By giving the people and their locally elected leaders a greater voice
         through changes such as revenue sharing, and by saying "no" to excessive
         Federal spending and higher taxes, we can help achieve this goal.</p>
      <p>COMING MESSAGES</p>
      <p>The policies which I will outline to the Congress in the weeks ahead
         represent a reaffirmation, not an abdication, of Federal responsibility.
         They represent a pragmatic rededication to social compassion and
         national excellence, in place of the combination of good intentions and
         fuzzy follow-through which too often in the past was thought sufficient.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the field of economic affairs, our objectives will be to hold down
            taxes, to continue controlling inflation, to promote economic growth, to
            increase productivity, to encourage foreign trade, to keep farm income
            high, to bolster small business, and to promote better labor-management
            relations</span>.</p>
      <p>In the area of natural resources, my recommendations will include
         programs to preserve and enhance the environment, to advance science and
         technology, and to assure balanced use of our irreplaceable natural
         resources.</p>
      <p>In developing human resources, I will have recommendations to advance
         the Nation's health and education, to improve conditions of people in
         need, to carry forward our increasingly successful attacks on crime,
         drug abuse and injustice, and to deal with such important areas of
         special concern as consumer affairs. <span class="war">We will continue and improve our
            Nation's efforts to assist those who have served in the Armed Services
            in Vietnam through better job and training opportunities</span>.</p>
      <p>We must do a better job in community development--in creating more
         livable communities, in which all of our children can grow up with
         fuller access to opportunity and greater immunity to the social evils
         and blights which now plague so many of our towns and cities. I shall
         have proposals to help us achieve this.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies, and with our
            new approaches to the role and structure of Government itself.</span></p>
      <p>Considered as a whole, this series of messages will be a blueprint for
         modernizing the concept and the functions of American Government to meet
         the needs of our people.</p>
      <p>Converting it into reality will require a spirit of cooperation and
         shared commitment on the part of all branches of the Government, for the
         goals we seek are not those of any single party or faction, they are
         goals for the betterment of all Americans. As President, I recognize
         that I cannot do this job alone. The Congress must help, and I pledge to
         do my part to achieve a constructive working relationship with the
         Congress. My sincere hope is that the executive and legislative branches
         can work together in this great undertaking in a positive spirit of
         mutual respect and cooperation.</p>
      <p>Working together--the Congress, the President and the people--I am
         confident that we can translate these proposals into an action program
         that can reform and revitalize American Government and, even more
         important, build a better life for all Americans.</p>

      <h3>January 30, 1974</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our
         distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>We meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great
         opportunities for America. We meet at a time when we face great problems
         at home and abroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a nation.
         But we also meet at a time when that fiber has been tested, and it has
         proved strong.</p>
      <p>America is a great and good land, and we are a great and good land
         because we are a strong, free, creative people and because America is
         the single greatest force for peace anywhere in the world. Today, as
         always in our history, we can base our confidence in what the American
         people will achieve in the future on the record of what the American
         people have achieved in the past.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Tonight, for the first time in 12 years, a President of the United
            States can report to the Congress on the state of a Union at peace with
            every nation of the world.</span> Because of this, in the 22,000-word message
         on the state of the Union that I have just handed to the Speaker of the
         House and the President of the Senate, I have been able to deal
         primarily with the problems of peace with what we can do here at home in
         America for the American people--rather than with the problems of war.</p>
      <p>The measures I have outlined in this message set an agenda for truly
         significant progress for this Nation and the world in 1974. Before we
         chart where we are going, let us see how far we have come.</p>
      <p>It was 5 years ago on the steps of this Capitol that I took the oath of
         office as your President. In those 5 years, because of the initiatives
         undertaken by this Administration, the world has changed. America has
         changed. As a result of those changes, America is safer today, more
         prosperous today, with greater opportunity for more of its people than
         ever before in our history.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Five years ago, America was at war in Southeast Asia. We were locked in
            confrontation with the Soviet Union.</span> We were in hostile isolation from a
         quarter of the world's people who lived in Mainland China.</p>
      <p>Five years ago, our cities were burning and besieged.</p>
      <p>Five years ago, our college campuses were a battleground.</p>
      <p>Five years ago, crime was increasing at a rate that struck fear across
         the Nation.</p>
      <p>Five years ago, the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening
         human and social tragedy of massive proportion, and there was no program
         to deal with it.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Five years ago--as young Americans had done for a generation before
            that--America's youth still lived under the shadow of the military
            draft.</span></p>
      <p>Five years ago, there was no national program to preserve our
         environment. Day by day, our air was getting dirtier, our water was
         getting more foul.</p>
      <p>And 5 years ago, American agriculture was practically a depressed
         industry with 100,000 farm families abandoning the farm every year.</p>
      <p>As we look at America today, we find ourselves challenged by new
         problems. But we also find a record of progress to confound the
         professional criers of doom and prophets of despair. We met the
         challenges we faced 5 years ago, and we will be equally confident of
         meeting those that we face today.</p>
      <p>Let us see for a moment how we have met them.</p>
      <p><span class="war">After more than 10 years of military involvement, all of our troops have
            returned from Southeast Asia, and they have returned with honor. And we
            can be proud of the fact that our courageous prisoners of war, for whom
            a dinner was held in Washington tonight, that they came home with their
            heads high, on their feet and not on their knees.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In our relations with the Soviet Union, we have turned away from a
            policy of confrontation to one of negotiation. For the first time since
            World War II, the world's two strongest powers are working together
            toward peace in the world. With the People's Republic of China after a
            generation of hostile isolation, we have begun a period of peaceful
            exchange and expanding trade.</span></p>
      <p>Peace has returned to our cities, to our campuses. The 17-year rise in
         crime has been stopped. We can confidently say today that we are finally
         beginning to win the war against crime. Right here in this Nation's
         Capital--which a few years ago was threatening to become the crime
         capital of the world--the rate in crime has been cut in half. A massive
         campaign against drug abuse has been organized. And the rate of new
         heroin addiction, the most vicious threat of all, is decreasing rather
         than increasing.</p>
      <p><span class="war">For the first time in a generation, no young Americans are being drafted
            into the armed services of the United States.</span> And for the first time
         ever, we have organized a massive national effort to protect the
         environment. Our air is getting cleaner, our water is getting purer, and
         our agriculture, which was depressed, is prospering. <span class="economy">Farm income is up
            70 percent, farm production is setting all-time records, and the
            billions of dollars the taxpayers were paying in subsidies has been cut
            to nearly zero.</span></p>
      <p>Overall, Americans are living more abundantly than ever before, today.
         <span class="economy">More than 2 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past year alone.
            That is the biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years. People are
            earning more. What they earn buys more, more than ever before in
            history. In the past 5 years, the average American's real spendable
            income--that is, what you really can buy with your income, even after
            allowing for taxes and inflation--has increased by 16 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Despite this record of achievement, as we turn to the year ahead we hear
            once again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling
            us now that because of the need to fight inflation, <span class="infra">because of the
               energy shortage,</span> America may be headed for a recession</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let me speak to that issue head on. There will be no recession in the
            United States of America. Primarily due to our energy crisis, our
            economy is passing through a difficult period. But I pledge to you
            tonight that the full powers of this Government will be used to keep
            America's economy producing and to protect the jobs of America's
            workers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation. There have
            been, and there will be in the future, ups and downs in that fight. But
            if this Congress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of
            Government, we shall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for
            the American people.</span></p>
      <p>As we look back over our history, the years that stand out as the ones
         of signal achievement are those in which the Administration and the
         Congress, whether one party or the other, working together, had the
         wisdom and the foresight to select those particular initiatives for
         which the Nation was ready and the moment was right--and in which they
         seized the moment and acted.</p>
      <p>Looking at the year 1974 which lies before us, there are 10 key areas in
         which landmark accomplishments are possible this year in America. If we
         make these our national agenda, this is what we will achieve in 1974:</p>
      <p><span class="infra">We will break the back of the energy crisis; we will lay the foundation
            for our future capacity to meet America's energy needs from America's
            own resources</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">And we will take another giant stride toward lasting peace in the
            world--not only by continuing our policy of negotiation rather than
            confrontation</span> <span class="diplomacy">where the great powers are concerned but also by helping
            toward the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle
            East</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh
            medicine of recession, and we will move the economy into a steady period
            of growth at a sustainable level.</span></p>
      <p>We will establish a new system that makes high-quality health care
         available to every American in a dignified manner and at a price he can
         afford.</p>
      <p>We will make our States and localities more responsive to the needs of
         their own citizens.</p>
      <p>We will make a crucial breakthrough toward better transportation in our
         towns and in our cities across America.</p>
      <p>We will reform our system of Federal aid to education, to provide it
         when it is needed, where it is needed, so that it will do the most for
         those who need it the most.</p>
      <p>We will make an historic beginning on the task of defining and
         protecting the right of personal privacy for every American.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">And we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that
            bleeds the taxpayer, corrodes the community, </span>and demeans those it is
         intended to assist.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And together with the other nations of the world, <span class="economy">we will establish the
               economic framework within which Americans will share more fully in an
               expanding worldwide trade and prosperity in the years ahead</span>, with more
            open access to both markets and supplies.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">In all of the 186 State of the Union messages delivered from this place,
            in our history this is the first in which the one priority, the first
            priority, is energy.</span> Let me begin by reporting a new development which I
         know will be welcome news to every American. As you know, we have
         committed ourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and
         durable peace in the Middle East, on the basis of full implementation of
         Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The first step in the process
         is the disengagement of Egyptian and Israeli forces which is now taking
         place.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Because of this hopeful development, I can announce tonight that I have
            been assured, through my personal contacts with friendly leaders in the
            Middle Eastern area,<span class="infra"> that an urgent meeting will be called in the
               immediate future to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo.</span></span></p>
      <p>This is an encouraging sign. However, it should be clearly understood by
         our friends in the Middle East that the United States will not be
         coerced on this issue.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, the cooperation of the
            American people in our energy conservation program has already gone a
            long way towards achieving a goal to which I am deeply dedicated. Let us
            do everything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the United States of
            America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Last week, I sent to the Congress a comprehensive special message
            setting forth our energy situation, recommending the legislative
            measures which are necessary to a program for meeting our needs.</span> If the
         embargo is lifted, this will ease the crisis, but it will not mean an
         end to the energy shortage in America. Voluntary conservation will
         continue to be necessary. And let me take this occasion to pay tribute
         once again to the splendid spirit of cooperation the American people
         have shown which has made possible our success in meeting this emergency
         up to this time.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">The new legislation I have requested will also remain necessary.
            Therefore, I urge again that the energy measures that I have proposed be
            made the first priority of this session of the Congress.</span> These measures
         will require the oil companies and other energy producers to provide the
         public with the necessary information on their supplies. They will
         prevent the injustice of windfall profits for a few as a result of the
         sacrifices of the millions of Americans. And they will give us the
         organization, the incentives, the authorities needed to deal with the
         short-term emergency and to move toward meeting our long-term needs.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Just as 1970 was the year in which we began a full-scale effort to
            protect the environment, 1974 must be the year in which we organize a
            full-scale effort to provide for our energy needs, not only in this
            decade but through the 21st century.</span></p>
      <p>As we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th
         anniversary of this Nation's independence, let us press vigorously on
         toward the goal I announced last November for Project Independence. Let
         this be our national goal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980,
         the United States will not be dependent on any other country for the
         energy we need to provide our jobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our
         transportation moving.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">To indicate the size of the Government commitment, to spur energy
            research and development,<span class="economy"> we plan to spend $10 billion in Federal funds
               over the next 5 years.</span> That is an enormous amount. But during the same 5
            years, private enterprise will be investing as much as $200 billion--and
            in 10 years, $500 billion--to develop the new resources, the new
            technology, the new capacity America will require for its energy needs
            in the 1980's. That is just a measure of the magnitude of the project we
            are undertaking.</span></p>
      <p>But America performs best when called to its biggest tasks. It can truly
         be said that only in America could a task so tremendous be achieved so
         quickly, and achieved not by regimentation, but through the effort and
         ingenuity of a free people, working in a free system.</p>
      <p>Turning now to the rest of the agenda for 1974, the time is at hand this
         year to bring comprehensive, high quality health care within the reach
         of every American. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will
         assure comprehensive health insurance protection to millions of
         Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved
         protection against catastrophic illnesses. This will be a plan that
         maintains the high standards of quality in America's health care. And it
         will not require additional taxes.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, I recognize that other plans have been put forward that would cost
            $80 billion or even $100 billion and that would put our whole health
            care system under the heavy hand of the Federal Government.</span> This is the
         wrong approach. This has been tried abroad, and it has failed. It is not
         the way we do things here in America. This kind of plan would threaten
         the quality of care provided by our whole health care system. The right
         way is one that builds on the strengths of the present system and one
         that does not destroy those strengths, one based on partnership, not
         paternalism. Most important of all, let us keep this as the guiding
         principle of our health programs. Government has a great role to play,
         but we must always make sure that our doctors will be working for their
         patients and not for the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>Many of you will recall that in my State of the Union Address 3 years
         ago, I commented that "Most Americans today are simply fed up with
         government at all levels," and I recommended a sweeping set of proposals
         to revitalize State and local governments, to make them more responsive
         to the people they serve. I can report to you today that as a result of
         revenue sharing passed by the Congress, and other measures, we have made
         progress toward that goal. After 40 years of moving power from the
         States and the communities to Washington, D.C., we have begun moving
         power back from Washington to the States and communities and, most
         important, to the people of America.</p>
      <p>In this session of the Congress, I believe we are near the breakthrough
         point on efforts which I have suggested, proposals to let people
         themselves make their own decisions for their own communities and, in
         particular, on those to provide broad new flexibility in Federal aid for
         community development, for economic development, for education. And I
         look forward to working with the Congress, with members of both parties
         in resolving whatever remaining differences we have in this legislation
         so that we can make available nearly $5 1/2 billion to our States and
         localities to use not for what a Federal bureaucrat may want, but for
         what their own people in those communities want. The decision should be
         theirs.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I think all of us recognize that the energy crisis has given new urgency
            to the need to improve public transportation, not only in our cities but
            in rural areas as well. </span>The program I have proposed this year will give
         communities not only more money but also more freedom to balance their
         own transportation needs. It will mark the strongest Federal commitment
         ever to the improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the
         improvement of life in our towns and cities.</p>
      <p>One goal on which all Americans agree is that our children should have
         the very best education this great Nation can provide.</p>
      <p>In a special message last week, I recommended a number of important new
         measures that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advances for our
         schools and for the children they serve. If the Congress will act on
         these proposals, more flexible funding will enable each Federal dollar
         to meet better the particular need of each particular school district.
         Advance funding will give school authorities a chance to make each
         year's plans, knowing ahead of time what Federal funds they are going to
         receive. Special targeting will give special help to the truly
         disadvantaged among our people. College students faced with rising costs
         for their education will be able to draw on an expanded program of loans
         and grants. These advances are a needed investment in America's most
         precious resource, our next generation. And I urge the Congress to act
         on this legislation in 1974.</p>
      <p>One measure of a truly free society is the vigor with which it protects
         the liberties of its individual citizens. As technology has advanced in
         America, it has increasingly encroached on one of those liberties--what
         I term the right of personal privacy. Modern information systems, data
         banks, credit records, mailing list abuses, electronic snooping, the
         collection of personal data for one purpose that may be used for
         another--all these have left millions of Americans deeply concerned by
         the privacy they cherish.</p>
      <p>And the time has come, therefore, for a major initiative to define the
         nature and extent of the basic rights of privacy and to erect new
         safeguards to ensure that those rights are respected.</p>
      <p>I shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the
         Administration, and I look forward again to working with this Congress
         in establishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs
         of society, but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal
         principle of American liberty.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Many of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years
            ago that I termed the Nation's welfare system "a monstrous, consuming
            outrage--an outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and
            particularly against the children that it is supposed to help."</span></p>
      <p>That system is still an outrage. By improving its administration, we
         have been able to reduce some of the abuses. As a result, last year, for
         the first time in 18 years, there has been a halt in the growth of the
         welfare caseload. But as a system, our welfare program still needs
         reform as urgently today as it did when I first proposed in 1969 that we
         completely replace it with a different system.</p>
      <p>In these final 3 years of my Administration, I urge the Congress to join
         me in mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present
         welfare system with one that works, one that is fair to those who need
         help or cannot help themselves, fair to the community, and fair to the
         taxpayer. And let us have as our goal that there will be no Government
         program which makes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to
         work.</p>
      <p>I recognize that from the debates that have taken place within the
         Congress over the past 3 years on this program that we cannot expect
         enactment overnight of a new reform. But I do propose that the Congress
         and the Administration together make this the year in which we discuss,
         debate, and shape such a reform so that it can be enacted as quickly as
         possible.</p>
      <p>America's own prosperity in the years ahead depends on our sharing fully
         and equitably in an expanding world prosperity. Historic negotiations
         will take place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment
         in international markets for American workers, American farmers,
         American investors, and American consumers.</p>
      <p>It is vital that the authorities contained in the trade bill I submitted
         to the Congress be enacted so that the United States can negotiate
         flexibly and vigorously on behalf of American interests. These
         negotiations can usher in a new era of international trade that not only
         increases the prosperity of all nations but also strengthens the <span class="economy">peace
            among all nations</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the past 5 years, we have made more progress toward a lasting
            structure of peace in the world than in any comparable time in the
            Nation's history. We could not have made that progress if we had not
            maintained the military strength of America</span>. Thomas Jefferson once
         observed that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. By the same
         token, and for the same reason, in today's world the price of peace is a
         strong defense as far as the United States is concerned.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In the past 5 years, we have steadily reduced the burden of national
            defense as a share of the budget, bringing it down from 44 percent in
            1969 to 29 percent in the current year. We have cut our military
            manpower over the past 5 years by more than a third, from 3.5 million to
            2.2 million.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In the coming year, however, increased expenditures will be needed. They
            will be needed to assure the continued readiness of our military forces,
            to preserve present force levels in the face of rising costs, and to
            give us the military strength we must have if our security is to be
            maintained and if our initiatives for peace are to succeed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The question is not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary
            strength of our defense, the question is whether we can afford not to
            maintain it, and the answer to that question is no. We must never allow
            America to become the second strongest nation in the world.</span></p>
      <p>I do not say this with any sense of belligerence, because I recognize
         the fact that is recognized around the world. <span class="economy">America's military
            strength has always been maintained to keep the peace, never to break
            it. It has always been used to defend freedom, never to destroy it. The
            world's peace, as well as our own, depends on our remaining as strong as
            we need to be as long as we need to be</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In this year 1974, we will be negotiating with the Soviet Union to place
            further limits on strategic nuclear arms.</span> Together with our allies, we
         will be negotiating with the nations of the Warsaw Pact on mutual and
         balanced reduction of forces in Europe. And we will continue our efforts
         to promote peaceful economic development in Latin America, in Africa, in
         Asia. We will press for full compliance with the peace accords that
         brought an end to American fighting in Indochina, including particularly
         a provision that promised the fullest possible accounting for those
         Americans who are missing in action.</p>
      <p>And having in mind the energy crisis to which I have referred to
         earlier, we will be working with the other nations of the world toward
         agreement on means by which oil supplies can be assured at reasonable
         prices on a stable basis in a fair way to the consuming and producing
         nations alike.</p>
      <p>All of these are steps toward a future in which the world's peace and
         prosperity, and ours as well as a result, are made more secure.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Throughout the 5 years that I have served as your President, I have had
            one overriding aim, and that was to establish a new structure of peace
            in the world that can free future generations of the scourge of war.</span> I
         can understand that others may have different priorities. This has been
         and this will remain my first priority and the chief legacy I hope to
         leave from the 8 years of my Presidency.</p>
      <p>This does not mean that we shall not have other priorities, because as
         we strengthen the peace, we must also continue each year a steady
         strengthening of our society here at home. Our conscience requires it,
         our interests require it, and we must insist upon it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">As we create more jobs, </span>as we build a better health care system, as we
         improve our education, <span class="infra">as we develop new sources of energy,</span> as we
         provide more abundantly for the elderly and the poor, as we strengthen
         the system of private enterprise that produces our prosperity--as we do
         all of this and even more, we solidify those essential bonds that hold
         us together as a nation.</p>
      <p>Even more importantly, we advance what in the final analysis government
         in America is all about.</p>
      <p>What it is all about is more freedom, more security, a better life for
         each one of the 211 million people that live in this land.</p>
      <p>We cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursuing peace
         abroad. But neither can we afford to neglect peace abroad while pursuing
         progress at home. With a stable peace, all is possible, but without
         peace, nothing is possible.</p>
      <p>In the written message that I have just delivered to the Speaker and to
         the President of the Senate, I commented that one of the continuing
         challenges facing us in the legislative process is that of the timing
         and pacing of our initiatives, selecting each year among many worthy
         projects those that are ripe for action at that time.</p>
      <p>What is true in terms of our domestic initiatives is true also in the
         world. This period we now are in, in the world--and I say this as one
         who has seen so much of the world, not only in these past 5 years but
         going back over many years--we are in a period which presents a juncture
         of historic forces unique in this century. They provide an opportunity
         we may never have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to
         last a lifetime and more, not just peace in our time but peace in our
         children's time as well. It is on the way we respond to this
         opportunity, more than anything else, that history will judge whether we
         in America have met our responsibility. And I am confident we will meet
         that great historic responsibility which is ours today.</p>
      <p>It was 27 years ago that John F. Kennedy and I sat in this Chamber, as
         freshmen Congressmen, hearing our first State of the Union address
         delivered by Harry Truman. I know from my talks with him, as members of
         the Labor Committee on which we both served, that neither of us then
         even dreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in
         this place that I now stand in now and that he once stood in, before me.
         It may well be that one of the freshmen Members of the 93d Congress, one
         of you out there, will deliver his own State of the Union message 27
         years from now, in the year 2001.</p>
      <p>Well, whichever one it is, I want you to be able to look back with pride
         and to say that your first years here were great years and<span class="war"> recall that
            you were here in this 93d Congress when America ended its longest war
            and began its longest peace.</span></p>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, and Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues and our
         guests: I would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that
         has been of great concern to all Americans over the past year. I refer,
         of course, to the investigations of the so-called Watergate affair. As
         you know, I have provided to the Special Prosecutor voluntarily a great
         deal of material. I believe that I have provided all the material that
         he needs to conclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the
         guilty and to clear the innocent.</p>
      <p>I believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other
         investigations of this matter to an end. One year of Watergate is
         enough.</p>
      <p>And the time has come, my colleagues, for not only the Executive, the
         President, but the Members of Congress, for all of us to join together
         in devoting our full energies to these great issues that I have
         discussed tonight which involve the welfare of all of the American
         people in so many different ways, as well as the peace of the world.</p>
      <p>I recognize that the House Judiciary Committee has a special
         responsibility in this area, and I want to indicate on this occasion
         that I will cooperate with the Judiciary Committee in its investigation.
         I will cooperate so that it can conclude its investigation, make its
         decision, and I will cooperate in any way that I consider consistent
         with my responsibilities to the Office of the Presidency of the United
         States.</p>
      <p>There is only one limitation. I will follow the precedent that has been
         followed by and defended by every President from George Washington to
         Lyndon B. Johnson of never doing anything that weakens the Office of the
         President of the United States or impairs the ability of the Presidents
         of the future to make the great decisions that are so essential to this
         Nation and the world.</p>
      <p>Another point I should like to make very briefly: Like every Member of
         the House and Senate assembled here tonight, I was elected to the office
         that I hold. And like every Member of the House and Senate, when I was
         elected to that office, I knew that I was elected for the purpose of
         doing a job and doing it as well as I possibly can. And I want you to
         know that I have no intention whatever of ever walking away from the job
         that the people elected me to do for the people of the United States.</p>
      <p>Now, needless to say, it would be understatement if I were not to admit
         that the year 1973 was not a very easy year for me personally or for my
         family. And as I have already indicated, the year 1974 presents very
         great and serious problems, as very great and serious opportunities are
         also presented.</p>
      <p>But my colleagues, this I believe: With the help of God, who has blessed
         this land so richly, with the cooperation of the Congress, and with the
         support of the American people, <span class="war">we can and we will make the year 1974 a
            year of unprecedented progress toward our goal of building a structure
            of lasting peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the
            United States of America.</span>
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_15,_1975" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>Gerald R. Ford</h2>
      <h3>January 15, 1975</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and
         distinguished guests:</p>
      <p>Twenty-six years ago, a freshman Congressman, a young fellow with lots
         of idealism who was out to change the world, stood before Sam Rayburn in
         the well of the House and solemnly swore to the same oath that all of
         you took yesterday--an unforgettable experience, and I congratulate you
         all.</p>
      <p>Two days later, that same freshman stood at the back of this great
         Chamber--over there someplace--as President Truman, all charged up by
         his single-handed election victory, reported as the Constitution
         requires on the state of the Union.</p>
      <p>When the bipartisan applause stopped, President Truman said, "I am happy
         to report to this 81st Congress that the state of the Union is good. Our
         Nation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the American
         people, and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness.
         [It] is foremost among the nations of the world in the search for
         peace."</p>
      <p>Today, that freshman Member from Michigan stands where Mr. Truman stood,
         and I must say to you that the state of the Union is not good:</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Millions of Americans are out of work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Prices are too high, and sales are too slow.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This year's Federal deficit will be about $30 billion; next year's
            probably $45 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The national debt will rise to over $500 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our plant capacity and productivity are not increasing fast enough.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We depend on others for essential energy.</span></p>
      <p>Some people question their Government's ability to make hard decisions
         and stick with them; they expect Washington politics as usual.</p>
      <p>Yet, what President Truman said on January 5, 1949, is even more true in
         1975. We are better able to meet our people's needs. All Americans do
         have a fairer chance to pursue happiness. Not only are we still the
         foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but today's prospects of
         attaining it are infinitely brighter.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">There were 59 million Americans employed at the start of 1949; now there
            are more than 85 million Americans who have jobs. In comparable dollars,
            the average income of the American family has doubled during the past 26
            years.</span></p>
      <p>Now, I want to speak very bluntly. I've got bad news, and I don't expect
         much, if any, applause. The American people want action, and it will
         take both the Congress and the President to give them what they want.
         Progress and solutions can be achieved, and they will be achieved.</p>
      <p>My message today is not intended to address all of the complex needs of
         America. I will send separate messages making specific recommendations
         for domestic legislation, such as the extension of general revenue
         sharing and the <span class="civil-rights">Voting Rights Act.</span></p>
      <p>The moment has come to move in a new direction. We can do this by
         fashioning a new partnership between the Congress on the one hand, the
         White House on the other, and the people we both represent.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let us mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation
            that ever existed on this Earth to put all our people to work. The
            emphasis on our economic efforts must now shift from inflation to jobs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To bolster business and industry and to create new jobs, I propose a
            1-year tax reduction of $16 billion. Three-quarters would go to
            individuals and one-quarter to promote business investment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This cash rebate to individuals amounts to 12 percent of 1974 tax
            payments--a total cut of $12 billion, with a maximum of $1,000 per
            return.</span></p>
      <p>I call on the Congress to act by April 1. If you do--and I hope you
         will--the Treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in
         May and the second by September.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The other one-fourth of the cut, about $4 billion, will go to business,
            including farms, to promote expansion and to create more jobs. The
            1-year reduction for businesses would be in the form of a liberalized
            investment tax credit increasing the rate to 12 percent for all
            businesses.</span></p>
      <p>This tax cut does not include the more fundamental reforms needed in our
         tax system. But it points us in the right direction--allowing taxpayers
         rather than the Government to spend their pay.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Cutting taxes now is essential if we are to turn the economy around. A
            tax cut offers the best hope of creating more jobs. Unfortunately, it
            will increase the size of the budget deficit. Therefore, it is more
            important than ever that we take steps to control the growth of Federal
            expenditures.</span></p>
      <p>Part of our trouble is that we have been self-indulgent. For decades, we
         have been voting ever-increasing levels of Government benefits, and now
         the bill has come due. We have been adding so many new programs that the
         size and the growth of the Federal budget has taken on a life of its
         own.</p>
      <p>One characteristic of these programs is that their cost increases
         automatically every year because the number of people eligible for most
         of the benefits increases every year. When these programs are enacted,
         there is no dollar amount set. No one knows what they will cost. All we
         know is that whatever they cost last year, they will cost more next
         year.</p>
      <p>It is a question of simple arithmetic. <span class="economy">Unless we check the excessive
            growth of Federal expenditures or impose on ourselves matching increases
            in taxes, we will continue to run huge inflationary deficits in the
            Federal budget.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">If we project the current built-in momentum of Federal spending through
            the next 15 years, State, Federal, and local government expenditures
            could easily comprise half of our gross national product.</span> This compares
         with less than a third in 1975.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I have just concluded the process of preparing the budget submissions
            for fiscal year 1976. In that budget, I will propose legislation to
            restrain the growth of a number of existing programs. I have also
            concluded that no new spending programs can be initiated this year,
            except for energy.</span> Further, I will not hesitate to veto any new spending
         programs adopted by the Congress.</p>
      <p>As an additional step toward putting the Federal Government's house in
         order, I recommend a 5-percent limit on Federal pay increases in 1975.
         In all Government programs tied to the Consumer Price Index--including
         <span class="economy">social security</span>, <span class="civil-rights">civil service</span> and <span class="war">military retirement pay</span>, and <span class="poverty">food
            stamps</span>--I also propose a 1-year maximum increase of 5 percent.</p>
      <p>None of these recommended ceiling limitations, over which Congress has
         final authority, are easy to propose, because in most cases they involve
         anticipated payments to many, many deserving people. Nonetheless, it
         must be done. I must emphasize that I am not asking to eliminate, to
         reduce, to freeze these payments. I am merely recommending that we slow
         down the rate at which these payments increase and these programs grow.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Only a reduction in the growth of spending can keep Federal borrowing
            down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest
            rates. Only a reduction in spending can make it possible for the Federal
            Reserve System to avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and
            thus restore balance to our economy. A major reduction in the growth of
            Federal spending can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about
            our economy and put us on the way to curing our economic ills.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">If we don't act to slow down the rate of increase in Federal spending,
            the United States Treasury will be legally obligated to spend more than
            $360 billion in fiscal year 1976, even if no new programs are enacted.
            </span>These are not matters of conjecture or prediction, but again, a matter
         of simple arithmetic. The size of these numbers and their implications
         for our everyday life and the health of our economic system are
         shocking.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I submitted to the last Congress a list of budget deferrals and
            rescissions. There will be more cuts recommended in the budget that I
            will submit. Even so, the level of outlays for fiscal year 1976 is still
            much, much too high. Not only is it too high for this year but the
            decisions we make now will inevitably have a major and growing impact on
            expenditure levels in future years</span>. I think this is a very fundamental
         issue that we, the Congress and I, must jointly solve.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Economic disruptions we and others are experiencing stem in part from
            the fact that the world price of petroleum has quadrupled in the last
            year</span>. But in all honesty,<span class="diplomacy"> we cannot put all of the blame on the
            oil-exporting nations. We, the United States, are not blameless. Our
            growing dependence upon foreign sources has been adding to our
            vulnerability for years and years, and we did nothing to prepare
            ourselves for such an event as the embargo of 1973.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">During the 1960's, this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil
            which we were able to make available to our trading partners whenever
            there was a disruption of supply. This surplus capacity enabled us to
            influence both supplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world.
            Our excess capacity neutralized any effort at establishing an effective
            cartel, and thus the rest of the world was assured of adequate supplies
            of oil at reasonable prices.</span></p>
      <p>By 1970, our surplus capacity had vanished, and as a consequence, the
         latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force. <span class="diplomacy">Europe and
            Japan, both heavily dependent on imported oil, now struggle to keep
            their economies in balance</span>. Even the United States, our country, which
         is far more self-sufficient than most other industrial countries, has
         been .put under serious pressure.</p>
      <p>I am proposing a program which will begin to <span class="infra">restore our country's
            surplus capacity in total energy. In this way, we will be able to assure
            ourselves reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world
            energy stability for other major consuming nations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">But this Nation and, in fact, the world must face the prospect of energy
            difficulties between now and 1985</span>. This program will impose burdens on
         all of us with the aim of reducing our consumption of energy and
         increasing our production. Great attention has been paid to the
         considerations of fairness, and <span class="poverty"> I can assure you that the burdens will
            not fall more harshly on those less able to bear them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I am recommending a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoffs of foreign
            oil. It will require sacrifices, but it--and this is most important--it
            will work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I have set the following national energy goals to assure that our future
            is as secure and as productive as our past:</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">First, we must reduce oil imports by 1 million barrels per day by the
            end of this year and by 2 million barrels per day by the end of 1977.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Second, we must end vulnerability to <span class="economy">economic disruption by <span class="diplomacy">foreign
                  suppliers by 1985.</span></span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Third, we must develop our energy technology and resources so that the
            United States has the ability to supply a significant share of the
            energy needs of the free world by the end of this century.</span></p>
      <p>To attain these objectives, we need immediate action to cut imports.
         Unfortunately, in the short term there are only a limited number of
         actions which can increase domestic supply. I will press for all of
         them.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial
            production at the Elk Hills, California, Naval Petroleum Reserve. In
            order that we make greater use of domestic coal resources, I am
            submitting amendments to the Energy Supply and Environmental
            Coordination Act which will greatly increase the number of powerplants
            that can be promptly converted to coal.</span></p>
      <p>Obviously, voluntary conservation continues to be essential, but tougher
         programs are needed--and needed now. <span class="infra"><span class="diplomacy">Therefore, I am using Presidential
               powers to raise the fee on all imported crude oil and petroleum
               products. The crude oil fee level will be increased $1 per barrel on
               February 1, by $2 per barrel on March 1, and by $3 per barrel on April
               1. I will take actions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical
               region. The foregoing are interim administrative actions. They will be
               rescinded when the broader but necessary legislation is enacted.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">To that end, I am requesting the Congress to act within 90 days on a
            more comprehensive energy tax program. It includes: excise taxes and
            import fees totaling $2 per barrel on product imports and on all crude
            oil; deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas
            excise tax.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I plan to take Presidential initiative to decontrol the price of
            domestic crude oil on April 1. I urge the Congress to enact a windfall
            profits tax by that date to ensure that oil producers do not profit
            unduly.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">The sooner Congress acts, the more effective the oil conservation
            program will be and the quicker the <span class="economy">Federal revenues can be returned to
               our people.</span></span></p>
      <p>I am prepared to use Presidential authority to limit imports, as
         necessary, to guarantee success.</p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="economy">I want you to know that before deciding on my energy conservation
               program, I considered rationing and higher gasoline taxes as
               alternatives. In my judgment, neither would achieve the desired results
               and both would produce unacceptable inequities.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">A massive program must be initiated to increase energy supply, to cut
            demand, and provide new standby emergency programs to achieve the
            independence we want by 1985</span>. The largest part of increased oil
         production must come from new frontier areas on the Outer Continental
         Shelf and from the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4 in Alaska. It is the
         intent of this Administration to move ahead with exploration, leasing,
         and production on those frontier areas of the Outer Continental Shelf
         where the environmental risks are acceptable.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Use of our most abundant domestic resource--coal--is severely limited.
            We must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concerns with
            coal. I am submitting Clean Air amendments which will allow greater coal
            use without sacrificing clean air goals.</span></p>
      <p>I vetoed the strip mining legislation passed by the last Congress. With
         appropriate changes, I will sign a revised version when it comes to the
         White House.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I am proposing a number of actions to energize our nuclear power
            program </span>. I will submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing and the
         rapid selection of sites.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In recent months, utilities have cancelled or postponed over 60 percent
            of planned nuclear expansion and 30 percent of planned additions to
            non-nuclear capacity. Financing problems for that industry are
            worsening. I am therefore recommending that the 1-year investment tax
            credit of 12 percent be extended an additional 2 years to specifically
            speed the construction of powerplants that do not use natural gas or
            oil. I am also submitting proposals for selective reform of State
            utility commission regulations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">To provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in
            the face of world price uncertainty, I will request legislation to
            authorize and require tariffs, import quotas, or price floors to protect
            our energy prices at levels which will achieve energy independence.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Increasing energy supplies is not enough. We must take additional steps
            to cut long-term consumption. I therefore propose to the Congress:
            legislation to make thermal efficiency standards mandatory for all new
            buildings in the United States; a new tax credit of up to $150 for those
            homeowners who install insulation equipment; the establishment of an
            energy conservation program to <span class="poverty">help low-income families purchase
               insulation supplies</span>; legislation to modify and defer automotive
            pollution standards for 5 years, which will enable us to improve
            automobile gas mileage by 40 percent by 1980.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">These proposals and actions, cumulatively, <span class="diplomacy">can reduce our dependence on
               foreign energy supplies from 3 to 5 million barrels per day by 1985. To
               make the United States invulnerable to foreign disruption, I propose
               standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of 1
               billion barrels of oil for domestic needs and 300 million barrels for
               national defense purposes.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I will ask for the funds needed for energy research and development
            activities. I have established a goal of 1 million barrels of synthetic
            fuels and shale oil production per day by 1985 together with an
            incentive program to achieve it.</span></p>
      <p>I have a very deep belief in America's capabilities. <span class="infra">Within the next 10
            years, my program envisions: 200 major nuclear powerplants; 250 major
            new coal mines; 150 major coal-fired powerplants; 30 major new
            refineries; 20 major new synthetic fuel plants; the drilling of many
            thousands of new oil wells; the insulation of 18 million homes; and the
            manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles, trucks, and
            buses that use much less fuel.</span></p>
      <p>I happen to believe that we can do it. <span class="war">In another crisis--the one in
            1942 President Franklin D. Roosevelt said this country would build
            60,000 military aircraft. By 1943, production in that program had
            reached 125,000 aircraft annually. They did it then. We can do it now.</span></p>
      <p>If the Congress and the American people will work with me to attain
         these targets, they will be achieved and will be surpassed. From
         adversity, let us seize opportunity. <span class="infra"><span class="economy">Revenues of some $30 billion from
               higher energy taxes designed to encourage conservation must be refunded
               to the American people in a manner which corrects distortions in our tax
               system wrought by inflation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">People have been pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation, with
            consequent reduction in their actual spending power. Business taxes are
            similarly distorted because inflation exaggerates reported profits,
            resulting in excessive taxes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Accordingly, I propose that future individual income taxes be reduced by
            $16.5 billion. This will be done by raising the low-income allowance and
            reducing tax rates. This continuing tax cut will primarily benefit
            <span class="poverty">lower-</span> and middle-income taxpayers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="economy">For example, a typical family of four with a gross income of $5,600 now
               pays $185 in Federal income taxes. Under this tax cut plan, they would
               pay nothing. A family of four with a gross income of $12,500 now pays
               $1,260 in Federal taxes. My proposal reduces that total by $300.
               Families grossing $20,000 would receive a reduction of $210.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="economy">Those with the very lowest incomes, who can least afford higher costs,
               must also be compensated. I propose a payment of $80 to every person 18
               years of age and older in that very limited category.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">State and local governments will receive $2 billion in additional
            revenue sharing to offset their increased energy costs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To offset inflationary distortions and to generate more economic
            activity, the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 48 percent to 42
            percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Now let me turn, if I might, to the international dimension of the
            present crisis. At no time in our peacetime history has the state of the
            Nation depended more heavily on the state of the world. And seldom, if
            ever, has the state of the world depended more heavily on the state of
            our Nation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The economic distress is global. <span class="diplomacy">We will not solve it at home unless we
               help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad. World trade and
               monetary structure provides markets, energy, food, and vital raw
               materials--for all nations.</span> This international system is now in
            jeopardy.</span></p>
      <p>This Nation can be proud of significant achievements in recent years in
         solving problems and crises. <span class="diplomacy">The Berlin agreement, the SALT agreements,
            our new relationship with China, the unprecedented efforts in the Middle
            East are immensely encouraging. But the world is not free from crisis.
            In a world of 150 nations, where nuclear technology is proliferating and
            regional conflicts continue, international security cannot be taken for
            granted.</span></p>
      <p>So, let there be no mistake about it: <span class="diplomacy">International cooperation is a
            vital factor of our lives today.</span> This is not a moment for the American
         people to turn inward. More than ever before, our own well-being depends
         on America's determination and America's leadership in the whole wide
         world.</p>
      <p>We are a great Nation--spiritually, politically, <span class="war">militarily,</span>
         <span class="diplomacy">diplomatically,</span> and <span class="economy">economically</span>. America's commitment to <span class="diplomacy">international
            security has sustained the safety of allies and friends in many
            areas--in the Middle East, in Europe, and in Asia. Our turning away
            would unleash new instabilities, new dangers around the globe, which, in
            turn, <span class="war">would threaten our own security.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">At the end of World War II, we turned a similar challenge into an
            historic opportunity and, I might add, an historic achievement.</span> An old
         order was in disarray; political and <span class="economy">economic institutions were
            shattered.</span> In that period, <span class="diplomacy">this Nation and its partners</span> <span class="infra">built new
            institutions,</span> new mechanisms of mutual support and cooperation. Today,
         as then, we face an historic opportunity. If we act imaginatively and
         boldly, as we acted then, this period will in retrospect be seen as one
         of the great creative moments of our Nation's history. The whole world
         is watching to see how we respond.</p>
      <p>A resurgent <span class="economy">American economy would do more to restore the confidence of
            the world in its own future than anything else we can do. The program
            that this Congress passes can demonstrate to the world that we have
            started to put our own house in order. If we can show that this Nation
            is able and willing to help other nations meet the common challenge, it
            can demonstrate that the United States will fulfill its responsibilities
            as a leader among nations.</span></p>
      <p>Quite frankly, at stake is the future of industrialized democracies,
         which have perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common
         for 30 years.</p>
      <p>The developing nations are also at a turning point. The <span class="poverty">poorest nations
            see their hopes of feeding their hungry</span> and <span class="economy">developing their societies
            shattered by the economic crisis. The long-term economic future for the
            producers of raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our relations with the Communist countries are a basic factor of the
            world environment. We must seek to build a long-term basis for
            coexistence. We will stand by our principles. We will stand by our
            interests. We will act firmly when challenged. The kind of a world we
            want depends on a broad policy of creating mutual incentives for
            restraint and for cooperation.</span></p>
      <p>As we move forward to meet our global challenges and opportunities, we
         must have the tools to do the job.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our military forces are strong and ready. This military strength deters
            aggression against our <span class="diplomacy">allies, stabilizes our relations with former
               adversaries, and protects our homeland. Fully adequate conventional and
               strategic forces cost many, many billions, but these dollars are sound
               insurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Military strength alone is not sufficient.</span> <span class="diplomacy">Effective diplomacy is also
            essential in preventing conflict, in building world understanding. The
            Vladivostok negotiations with the Soviet Union represent a major step in
            moderating strategic arms competition. My recent discussions with the
            leaders of the Atlantic community, Japan, and South Korea have
            contributed to meeting the common challenge.</span></p>
      <p>But we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between
         the President and the Congress. By the Constitution and tradition, <span class="diplomacy">the
            execution of foreign policy is the responsibility of the President.</span></p>
      <p>In recent years, <span class="war">under the stress of the Vietnam war, legislative
            restrictions on the President's ability to execute <span class="diplomacy">foreign policy and
               military decisions have proliferated.</span></span> As a Member of the Congress, I
         opposed some and I approved others. As President, I welcome the advice
         and cooperation of the House and the Senate.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But if our foreign policy is to be successful, we cannot rigidly
            restrict in legislation the ability of the President to act. The conduct
            of negotiations is ill-suited to such limitations. Legislative
            restrictions, intended for the best motives and purposes, can have the
            opposite result, as we have seen most recently in our trade relations
            with the Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p>For my part, I pledge this Administration will act in the closest
         consultation with the Congress as we face delicate situations and
         troubled times throughout the globe.</p>
      <p>When I became President only 5 months ago, I promised the last Congress
         a policy of communication, conciliation, compromise, and cooperation. I
         renew that pledge to the new Members of this Congress.</p>
      <p>Let me sum it up. America needs a new direction, which I have sought to
         chart here today--a change of course which will: <span class="poverty">put the unemployed back
            to work;</span> <span class="economy">increase real income and production; restrain the growth of
            Federal Government spending; achieve energy independence; and advance
            the cause of world understanding.</span></p>
      <p>We have the ability. We have the know-how. In partnership with the
         American people, we will achieve these objectives.</p>
      <p>As our 200th anniversary approaches, we owe it to ourselves and to
         posterity to rebuild our political and <span class="economy">economic strength.</span> Let us make
         America once again and for centuries more to come what it has so long
         been--a stronghold and a beacon-light of liberty for the whole world.</p>
      <p>Thank you.

      <h3>January 19, 1976</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and
         distinguished guests:</p>
      <p>As we begin our Bicentennial, America is still one of the youngest
         nations in recorded history. Long before our forefathers came to these
         shores, men and women had been struggling on this planet to forge a
         better life for themselves and their families.</p>
      <p>In man's long, upward march from savagery and <span class="civil-rights">slavery--throughout the
            nearly 2,000 years of the Christian calendar, the nearly 6,000 years of
            Jewish reckoning</span>--there have been many deep, terrifying valleys, but
         also many bright and towering peaks.</p>
      <p>One peak stands highest in the ranges of human history. One example
         shines forth of a people uniting to produce abundance and to share the
         good life fairly and with freedom. One union holds out the promise of
         justice and opportunity for every citizen: That union is the United
         States of America.</p>
      <p>We have not remade paradise on Earth. We know perfection will not be
         found here. But think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years.</p>
      <p>We came from many roots, and we have many branches. Yet all Americans
         across the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of
         1776, those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge
         among our shores, say in unison:</p>
      <p>I am proud of America, and I am proud to be an American. Life will be a
         little better here for my children than for me. I believe this not
         because I am told to believe it, but because life has been better for me
         than it was for my father and my mother. I know it will be better for my
         children because my hands, my brains, my voice, and my vote can help
         make it happen.</p>
      <p>It has happened here in America. It has happened to you and to me.
         Government exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can
         translate their ideas into practical reality. In the best of times, much
         is lost in translation. But we try. Sometimes we have tried and failed.
         Always we have had the best of intentions.</p>
      <p>But in the recent past, we sometimes forgot the sound principles that
         guided us through most of our history. We wanted to accomplish great
         things and solve age-old problems. And we became overconfident of our
         abilities. We tried to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent
         here at home.</p>
      <p>We thought we could transform the country through massive national
         programs, but often the programs did not work. Too often they only made
         things worse. In our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly, we trampled
         on sound principles of restraint and <span class="civil-rights">endangered the rights of
            individuals.</span> <span class="economy">We unbalanced our economic system by the huge and
            unprecedented growth of Federal expenditures and borrowing.</span> And we were
         not totally honest with ourselves about how much these programs would
         cost and how we would pay for them. Finally, <span class="war">we shifted our emphasis
            from defense to domestic problems while our adversaries continued a
            massive buildup of arms.</span></p>
      <p>The time has now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new
         realism that is true to the great principles upon which this Nation was
         founded.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must introduce a new balance to our economy--a balance that favors
            not only sound, active government but also a much more vigorous, healthy
            economy that can create new jobs and hold down prices.</span></p>
      <p>We must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the
         individual and the government--a balance that favors greater individual
         freedom and self-reliance.</p>
      <p>We must strike a new balance in our system of federalism--a balance that
         favors greater responsibility and freedom for the leaders of our State
         and local governments.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic
            programs and <span class="war">spending on defense--a balance that ensures we will fully
               meet our obligation to the needy while also protecting our security in a
               world that is still hostile to freedom.</span></span></p>
      <p>And in all that we do, we must be more honest with the American people,
         promising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we
         promise.</p>
      <p>The genius of America has been its incredible ability to improve the
         lives of its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and
         free citizen activity.</p>
      <p>History and experience tells us that moral progress cannot come in
         comfortable and in complacent times, but out of trial and out of
         confusion. Tom Paine aroused the troubled Americans of 1776 to stand up
         to the times that try men's souls because the harder the conflict, the
         more glorious the triumph.</p>
      <p>Just a year ago I reported that the state of the Union was not good.
         Tonight, I report that the state of our Union is better--in many ways a
         lot better--but still not good enough.</p>
      <p>To paraphrase Tom Paine, 1975 was not a year for summer soldiers and
         sunshine patriots. It was a year of fears and alarms and of dire
         forecasts--most of which never happened and won't happen.</p>
      <p>As you recall, the year 1975 opened with rancor and with bitterness.
         Political misdeeds of the past had neither been forgotten nor forgiven.
         <span class="war">The longest, most divisive war in our history was winding toward an
            unhappy conclusion. Many feared that the end of that foreign war of men
            and machines meant the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and
            reprisal. Friends and adversaries abroad were asking whether America had
            lost its nerve.</span> <span class="economy">Finally, our economy was ravaged by inflation--inflation
            that was plunging us into the worst recession in four decades.</span> At the
         same time, Americans became increasingly alienated from big
         institutions. They were steadily losing confidence, not just in big
         government but in big business, big labor, and big education, among
         others. Ours was a troubled land.</p>
      <p>And so, 1975 was a year of hard decisions, difficult compromises, and a
         new realism that taught us something important about America. It brought
         back a needed measure of common sense, steadfastness, and
         self-discipline.</p>
      <p>Americans did not panic or demand instant but useless cures. In all
         sectors, people met their difficult problems with the restraint and with
         responsibility worthy of their great heritage.</p>
      <p>Add up the separate pieces of progress in 1975, subtract the setbacks,
         and the sum total shows that we are not only headed in a new direction,
         a direction which I proposed 12 months ago, but it turned out to be the
         right direction.</p>
      <p>It is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary
         American concept of 1776, which holds that in a free society the making
         of public policy and successful problem-solving involves much more than
         government. It involves a full partnership among all branches and all
         levels of government, private institutions, and individual citizens.</p>
      <p>Common sense tells me to stick to that steady course.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Take the state of our economy. Last January, most things were rapidly
            getting worse. This January, most things are slowly but surely getting
            better.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The worst recession since World War II turned around in April. The best
            cost-of-living news of the past year is that double-digit inflation of
            12 percent or higher was cut almost in half. <span class="poverty">The worst--unemployment
               remains far too high.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Today, nearly 1,700,000 more Americans are working than at the bottom of
            the recession. At year's end, people were again being hired much faster
            than they were being laid off.</span></p>
      <p>Yet, let's be honest. Many Americans have not yet felt these changes in
         their daily lives. <span class="economy">They still see prices going up far too fast, and they
            still know the fear of unemployment.</span></p>
      <p>We are also a growing nation. <span class="economy">We need more and more jobs every year.
            Today's economy has produced over 85 million jobs for Americans, but we
            need a lot more jobs, especially for the young.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">My first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We all know from recent experience what runaway inflation does to ruin
            every other worthy purpose. We are slowing it. We must stop it cold.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">For many Americans, the way to a healthy, noninflationary economy has
            become increasingly apparent. The Government must stop spending so much
            and stop borrowing so much of our money. More money must remain in
            private hands where it will do the most good. To hold down the cost of
            living, we must hold down the cost of government.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the past decade, the Federal budget has been growing at an average
            rate of over 10 percent a year. The budget I am submitting Wednesday
            cuts this rate of growth in half. I have kept my promise to submit a
            budget for the next fiscal year of $395 billion. In fact, it is $394.2
            billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">By holding down the growth of Federal spending, we can afford additional
            tax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking
            power over their own lives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last month I signed legislation to extend the 1975 tax reductions for
            the first 6 months of this year. I now propose that effective July 1,
            1976, we give our taxpayers a tax cut of approximately $10 billion more
            than Congress agreed to in December.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">My broader tax reduction would mean that for a family of four making
            $15,000 a year, there will be $227 more in take-home pay annually.
            Hardworking Americans caught in the middle can really use that kind of
            extra cash.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">My recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of Federal
            spending and for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward.
            For every dollar saved in cutting the growth in the Federal budget, we
            can have an added dollar of Federal tax reduction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the
            wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of Federal spending.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">One test of a healthy economy is a job for every American who wants to
            work. Government--our kind of government--cannot create that many jobs.
            But the Federal Government can create conditions and incentives for
            private business and industry to make more and more jobs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Five out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in
            industry. Common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs
            and to find them faster. I mean real, rewarding, permanent jobs.</span></p>
      <p>To achieve this we must offer the American people greater incentives to
         invest in the future. <span class="economy">My tax proposals are a major step in that
            direction. To supplement these proposals, I ask that Congress enact
            changes in Federal tax laws that will speed up <span class="infra">plant expansion and the
               purchase of new equipment.</span> My recommendations will concentrate this
            job-creation tax incentive in areas where the unemployment rate now runs
            over 7 percent.</span> Legislation to get this started must be approved at the
         earliest possible date.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Within the strict budget total that I will recommend for the coming
            year, I will ask for additional housing assistance for 500,000 families.
            These programs will expand housing opportunities, <span class="infra">spur construction, </span>and
            help to house moderate- and <span class="poverty">low-income families.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975. But with
            lower interest rates and available mortgage money, we can have a healthy
            recovery in 1976.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">A necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty
            tyranny of massive government regulation. We are wasting literally
            millions of working hours costing billions of taxpayers' and consumers'
            dollars because of bureaucratic redtape. The American farmer, who now
            feeds 215 million Americans, but also millions worldwide, has shown how
            much more he can produce without the shackles of government control.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy: the
            airlines, trucking, railroads, and financial institutions. I have
            submitted concrete plans in each of these areas, not to help this or
            that industry, but to foster competition and to bring prices down for
            the consumer.</span></p>
      <p>This administration, in addition, will strictly enforce the Federal
         antitrust laws for the very same purposes.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">Taking a longer look at America's future, there can be neither sustained
               growth nor more jobs unless we continue to have an assured supply of
               energy to run our economy. Domestic production of oil and gas is still
               declining. Our dependence on foreign oil at high prices is still too
               great, draining jobs and dollars away from our own economy at the rate
               of $125 per year for every American.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Last month, I signed a compromise national energy bill which enacts a
            part of my comprehensive energy independence program. This legislation
            was late, not the complete answer to energy independence, but still a
            start in the right direction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I again urge the Congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of
            my energy proposals to make America invulnerable to the foreign oil
            cartel</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">My proposals, as all of you know, would reduce domestic natural gas
            shortages; allow production from Federal petroleum reserves; stimulate
            effective conservation, including revitalization of our railroads and
            the expansion of our urban transportation systems; develop more and
            cleaner energy from our vast coal resources; expedite clean and safe
            nuclear power production; create a new national energy independence
            authority to stimulate vital energy investment; and accelerate
            development of technology to capture energy from the Sun and the Earth
            for this and future generations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Also, I ask, for the sake of future generations, that we preserve the
            family farm and family-owned small business. Both strengthen America and
            give stability to our economy. I will propose estate tax changes so that
            family businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to
            generation without having to be sold to pay taxes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I propose tax changes to encourage people to invest in America's future,
            and their own, through a plan that gives moderate-income families income
            tax benefits if they make long-term investments in common stock in
            American companies.</span></p>
      <p>The Federal Government must and will respond to clear-cut national
         needs--for this and future generations.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Hospital and medical services in America are among the best in the
            world, but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe
            out a family's lifetime savings. Increasing health costs are of deep
            concern to all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living. The
            burden of catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society.
            We must eliminate this fear from every family.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by
            Medicare. To finance this added protection, fees for short-term care
            will go up somewhat, but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay
            more than $500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care, nor
            more than $250 for 1 year's doctor bills.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health
            insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans. The
            experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well
            as the cost of such plans. But I do envision the day when we may use the
            private health insurance system to offer more middle-income families
            high quality health services at prices they can afford and shield them
            also from their catastrophic illnesses.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Using resources now available, I propose <span class="poverty">improving the Medicare and
               other Federal health programs to help those who really need
               protection--older people and the poor. To help States and local
               governments give better health care to the poor, I propose that we
               combine 16 existing Federal programs, including Medicaid, into a single
               $10 billion Federal grant</span></span>.</p>
      <p>Funds would be divided among States under a new formula which provides a
         larger share of Federal money to those States that have a larger share
         of <span class="poverty">low-income families.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="war">I will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital
               care for those who have served in our Armed Forces.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now let me speak about social security. Our Federal social security
            system for people who have worked and contributed to it for all their
            lives is a vital part of our economic system. Its value is no longer
            debatable. In my budget for fiscal year 1977, I am recommending that the
            full cost-of-living increases in the social security benefits be paid
            during the coming year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">But I am concerned about the integrity of our Social Security Trust Fund
            that enables people--those retired and those still working who will
            retire--to count on this source of retirement income. Younger workers
            watch their deductions rise and wonder if they will be adequately
            protected in the future. We must meet this challenge head on. Simple
            arithmetic warns all of us that the Social Security Trust Fund is headed
            for trouble. Unless we act soon to make sure the fund takes in as much
            as it pays out, there will be no security for old or for young.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I must, therefore, recommend a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in
            both employer and employee social security taxes effective January 1,
            1977. This will cost each covered employee less than 1 extra dollar a
            week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">As we rebuild our economy, we have a continuing responsibility to
            provide a temporary cushion to the <span class="poverty">unemployed. At my request, the
               Congress enacted two extensions and two expansions in unemployment
               insurance which helped those who were jobless during 1975. These
               programs will continue in 1976.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In my fiscal year 1977 budget, I am also requesting funds to continue
            proven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of
            other Americans.</span></p>
      <p>Compassion and a sense of community--two of America's greatest strengths
         throughout our history--tell us we must take care of our neighbors who
         cannot take care of themselves. The host of Federal programs in this
         field reflect our generosity as a people.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">But everyone realizes that when it comes to welfare, government at all
            levels is not doing the job well. Too many of our welfare programs are
            inequitable and invite abuse. Too many of our welfare programs have
            problems from beginning to end. Worse, we are wasting badly needed
            resources without reaching many of the truly needy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Complex welfare programs cannot be reformed overnight. Surely we cannot
            simply dump welfare into the laps of the 50 States, their local
            taxpayers, or their private charities, and just walk away from it. Nor
            is it the right time for massive and sweeping changes while we are still
            recovering from the recession.</span></p>
      <p>Nevertheless, there are still plenty of improvements that we can make. I
         will ask Congress for Presidential authority to tighten up the rules for
         eligibility and benefits.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Last year I twice sought long overdue reform of the scandal-riddled food
            stamp program. This year I say again: Let's give food stamps to those
            most in need. Let's not give any to those who don't need them.</span></p>
      <p>Protecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the
         responsibility of all public officials, but is primarily the job of
         local and State law enforcement authorities.</p>
      <p>Americans have always found the very thought of a Federal police force
         repugnant, and so do I. But there are proper ways in which we can help
         to insure domestic tranquility as the Constitution charges us.</p>
      <p>My recommendations on how to control violent crime were submitted to the
         Congress last June with strong emphasis on protecting the innocent
         victims of crime. To keep a convicted criminal from committing more
         crimes, we must put him in prison so he cannot harm more law-abiding
         citizens. To be effective, this punishment must be swift and it must be
         certain.</p>
      <p>Too often, criminals are not sent to prison after conviction but are
         allowed to return to the streets. Some judges are reluctant to send
         convicted criminals to prison because of inadequate facilities. <span class="infra">To
            alleviate this problem at the Federal level, my new budget proposes the
            construction of four new Federal facilities.</span></p>
      <p>To speed Federal justice, I propose an increase this year in the United
         States attorneys prosecuting Federal crimes and the reinforcement of the
         number of United States marshals. Additional Federal judges are needed,
         as recommended by me and the Judicial Conference.</p>
      <p>Another major threat to every American's person and property is the
         criminal carrying a handgun. The way to cut down on the criminal use of
         guns is not to take guns away from the law-abiding citizen, but to
         impose mandatory sentences for crimes in which a gun is used, make it
         harder to obtain cheap guns for criminal purposes, and concentrate gun
         control enforcement in highcrime areas.</p>
      <p>My budget recommends 500 additional Federal agents in the 11 largest
         metropolitan high-crime areas to help local authorities stop criminals
         from selling and using handguns.</p>
      <p>The sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again. I have
         directed all agencies of the Federal Government to step up law
         enforcement efforts against those who deal in drugs. In 1975, I am glad
         to report, Federal agents seized substantially more heroin coming into
         our country than in 1974.</p>
      <p>As President, I have talked personally with the leaders of Mexico,
         Colombia, and Turkey to urge greater efforts by their Governments to
         control effectively the production and shipment of hard drugs.</p>
      <p>I recommended months ago that the Congress enact mandatory fixed
         sentences for persons convicted of Federal crimes involving the sale of
         hard drugs. Hard drugs, we all know, degrade the spirit as they destroy
         the body of their users.</p>
      <p>It is unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the Federal
         Government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime. Under
         the Constitution, the greatest responsibility for curbing crime lies
         with State and local authorities. They are the frontline fighters in the
         war against crime.</p>
      <p>There are definite ways in which the Federal Government can help them. I
         will propose in the new budget that Congress authorize almost $7 billion
         over the next 5 years to assist State and local governments to protect
         the safety and property of all their citizens.</p>
      <p>As President, I pledge the strict enforcement of Federal laws and--by
         example, support, and leadership--to help State and local authorities
         enforce their laws. Together, we must protect the victims of crime and
         ensure domestic tranquility.</p>
      <p>Last year I strongly recommended a 5-year extension of the existing
         revenue sharing legislation, which thus far has provided $23 1/2 billion
         to help State and local units of government solve problems at home. This
         program has been effective with decisionmaking transferred from the
         Federal Government to locally elected officials. Congress must act this
         year, or State and local units of government will have to drop programs
         or raise local taxes.</p>
      <p>Including my health care program reforms, I propose to consolidate some
         59 separate Federal programs and provide flexible Federal dollar grants
         to help States, cities, and local agencies in such important areas as
         education, child nutrition, and social services. This flexible system
         will do the job better and do it closer to home.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The protection of the lives and property of Americans from foreign
            enemies is one of my primary responsibilities as President.</span></p>
      <p>In a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic
         missiles, <span class="economy">in a world economy that is global and interdependent, <span class="diplomacy">our
               relations with other nations become more, not less, important to the
               lives of Americans.</span></span></p>
      <p>America has had a unique role in the world since the day of our
         independence 200 years ago. <span class="war">And ever since the end of World War II, we
            have borne--successfully--a heavy responsibility for ensuring a stable
            world order and hope for human progress.</span></p>
      <p>Today, <span class="diplomacy">the state of our foreign policy is sound and strong. We are at
            peace, and I will do all in my power to keep it that way.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our military forces are capable and ready. Our military power is without
            equal, and I intend to keep it that way.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the Atlantic
            community and Japan have never been more solid.</span></p>
      <p>A further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have an improving relationship with China, the world's most populous
            nation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The key elements for peace among the nations of the Middle East now
            exist. Our traditional friendships in Latin America, Africa, and Asia
            continue.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have taken the role of leadership in launching a serious and hopeful
            dialog between the industrial world and the developing world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">We have helped to achieve significant reform of the international
               monetary system.</span></span></p>
      <p>We should be proud of what America, what our country, has accomplished
         in these areas, and I believe the American people are.</p>
      <p>The American people have heard too much about how terrible our mistakes,
         how evil our deeds, and how misguided our purposes. The American people
         know better.</p>
      <p>The truth is we are the world's greatest democracy. We remain the symbol
         of man's aspiration for liberty and well-being. We are the embodiment of
         hope for progress.</p>
      <p>I say it is time we quit downgrading ourselves as a nation. Of course,
         it is our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistakes.
         It is our duty to see that they never happen again. But our greater duty
         is to look to the future. The world's troubles will not go away.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The American people want strong and effective international and defense
            policies.</span> In our constitutional system, these policies should reflect
         consultation and accommodation between the President and the Congress.
         <span class="diplomacy">But in the final analysis, as the framers of our Constitution knew from
            hard experience, the foreign relations of the United States can be
            conducted effectively only if there is strong central direction that
            allows flexibility of action</span>. That responsibility clearly rests with the
         President.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I pledge to the American people policies which seek a secure, just, and
            peaceful world. I pledge to the Congress to work with you to that end.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must not face a future in which we can no longer help our friends,
            such as Angola, even in limited and carefully controlled ways.</span> <span class="war">We must
            not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Some hasty actions of the Congress during the past year--most recently
            in respect to Angola--were, in my view, very shortsighted.
            Unfortunately, they are still very much on the minds of our allies and
            our adversaries.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">A strong defense posture gives weight to our values and our views in
            international negotiations. It assures the vigor of our alliances.</span> <span class="war">And
            it sustains our efforts to promote settlements of international
            conflicts. Only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced
            agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arms. Only a balanced agreement
            will serve our interests and minimize the threat of nuclear
            confrontation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The defense budget I will submit to the Congress for fiscal year 1977
            will show an essential increase over the current year. It provides for
            real growth in purchasing power over this year's defense budget, which
            includes the cost of the all-volunteer force.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">We are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our
               military forces.</span> But the budget I will submit represents the necessity
            of American strength for the real world in which we live.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">As conflict and rivalry persist in the world, our United States
            intelligence capabilities must be the best in the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger
            of American involvement in direct armed conflict. <span class="diplomacy">Our adversaries are
               encouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor
               events and to influence events short of military action is undermined.
               Without effective intelligence capability, the United States stands
               blindfolded and hobbled.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In the near future, I will take actions to reform and strengthen our
            intelligence community. I ask for your positive cooperation. It is time
            to go beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective, responsible, and
            responsive intelligence capability.</span></p>
      <p>Tonight I have spoken about our problems at home and abroad. I have
         recommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century.
         I have no doubt that our Union will endure, better, stronger, and with
         more individual freedom. We can see forward only dimly--1 year, 5 years,
         a generation perhaps. Like our forefathers, we know that if we meet the
         challenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and
         conviction, if we remain true to our Constitution and to our ideals,
         then we can know that the future will be better than the past.</p>
      <p>I see America today crossing a threshold, not just because it is our
         Bicentennial but because we have been tested in adversity. We have taken
         a new look at what we want to be and what we want our Nation to become.</p>
      <p>I see America resurgent, certain once again that life will be better for
         our children than it is for us, seeking strength that cannot be counted
         in megatons and riches that cannot be eroded by inflation.</p>
      <p>I see these United States of America moving forward as before toward a
         more perfect Union where the government serves and the people rule.</p>
      <p>We will not make this happen simply by making speeches, good or bad,
         yours or mine, but by hard work and hard decisions made with courage and
         with common sense.</p>
      <p>I have heard many inspiring Presidential speeches, but the words I
         remember best were spoken by Dwight D. Eisenhower. "America is not good
         because it is great," the President said. "America is great because it
         is good."</p>
      <p>President Eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the
         heart of America. His simple words echoed President Lincoln's eloquent
         testament that "right makes might." And Lincoln in turn evoked the
         silent image of George Washington kneeling in prayer at Valley Forge.</p>
      <p>So, all these magic memories which link eight generations of Americans
         are summed up in the inscription just above me. How many times have we
         seen it? "In God We Trust."</p>
      <p>Let us engrave it now in each of our hearts as we begin our
         Bicentennial.

      <h3>January 12, 1977</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 95th Congress, and
         distinguished guests:</p>
      <p>In accordance with the Constitution, I come before you once again to
         report on the state of the Union.</p>
      <p>This report will be my last--maybe--[laughter]--but for the Union it is
         only the first of such reports in our third century of independence, the
         close of which none of us will ever see. We can be confident, however,
         that 100 years from now a freely elected President will come before a
         freely elected Congress chosen to renew our great Republic's pledge to
         the Government of the people, by the people, and for the people.</p>
      <p>For my part I pray the third century we are beginning will bring to all
         Americans, our children and their children's children, a greater measure
         of individual equality, opportunity, and justice, a greater abundance of
         spiritual and material blessings, and a higher quality of life, liberty,
         and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
      <p>The state of the Union is a measurement of the many elements of which it
         is composed--a political union of diverse States, <span class="economy">an economic union of
            varying interests</span>, an intellectual union of common convictions, and a
         moral union of immutable ideals.</p>
      <p>Taken in sum, I can report that the state of the Union is good. There is
         room for improvement, as always, but today we have a more perfect Union
         than when my stewardship began.</p>
      <p>As a people we discovered that our Bicentennial was much more than a
         celebration of the past; it became a joyous reaffirmation of all that it
         means to be Americans, a confirmation before all the world of the
         vitality and durability of our free institutions. I am proud to have
         been privileged to preside over the affairs of our Federal Government
         during these eventful years when we proved, as I said in my first words
         upon assuming office, that "our Constitution works; our great Republic
         is a Government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule."</p>
      <p>The people have spoken; they have chosen a new President and a new
         Congress to work their will. I congratulate you--particularly the new
         Members--as sincerely as I did President-elect Carter. In a few days it
         will be his duty to outline for you his priorities and legislative
         recommendations. Tonight I will not infringe on that responsibility, but
         rather wish him the very best in all that is good for our country.</p>
      <p>During the period of my own service in this Capitol and in the White
         House, I can recall many orderly transitions of governmental
         responsibility--of problems as well as of position, of burdens as well
         as of power. The genius of the American system is that we do this so
         naturally and so normally. There are no soldiers marching in the street
         except in the Inaugural Parade; no public demonstrations except for some
         of the dancers at the Inaugural Ball; the opposition party doesn't go
         underground, but goes on functioning vigorously in the Congress and in
         the country; and our vigilant press goes right on probing and publishing
         our faults and our follies, confirming the wisdom of the framers of the
         first amendment.</p>
      <p>Because of the transfer of authority in our form of government affects
         the state of the Union and of the world, I am happy to report to you
         that the current transition is proceeding very well. I was determined
         that it should; I wanted the new President to get off on an easier start
         than I had.</p>
      <p>When I became President on August 9, 1974, our Nation was deeply divided
         and tormented. In rapid succession the Vice President and the President
         had resigned in disgrace. <span class="war">We were still struggling with the
            after-effects of a long, unpopular, and bloody war in Southeast Asia</span>.
         <span class="economy">The economy was unstable and racing toward the worst recession in 40
            years. People were losing jobs. The cost of living was soaring.</span> The
         Congress and the Chief Executive were at loggerheads. The integrity of
         our constitutional process and other institutions was being questioned.
         For more than 15 years domestic spending had soared as Federal programs
         multiplied, and the expense escalated annually. During the same period
         our national security needs were steadily shortchanged. In the grave
         situation which prevailed in August 1974, our will to maintain our
         international leadership was in doubt.</p>
      <p>I asked for your prayers and went to work.</p>
      <p>In January 1975 I reported to the Congress that the state of the Union
         was not good. <span class="economy">I proposed urgent action to improve the economy</span> <span class="infra">and to
            achieve energy independence in 10 years.</span> <span class="diplomacy">I reassured America's allies</span>
         and <span class="war">sought to reduce the danger of confrontation with potential
            adversaries.</span> I pledged a new direction for America. 1975 was a year of
         difficult decisions, but Americans responded with realism, common sense,
         and self-discipline.</p>
      <p>By January 1976 we were headed in a new direction, which I hold to be
         the right direction for a free society. It was guided by the belief that
         successful problem-solving requires more than Federal action alone, that
         it involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of
         government and public policies which nurture and promote the creative
         energies of private enterprises, institutions, and individual citizens.</p>
      <p>A year ago I reported that the state of the Union was better--in many
         ways a lot better--but still not good enough. Common sense told me to
         stick to the steady course we were on, <span class="economy">to continue to restrain the
            inflationary growth of government, to reduce taxes as well as spending,</span>
         to return local decisions to local officials, <span class="infra"><span class="war">to provide for long-range
               sufficiency in energy and national security needs.</span></span> I resisted the
         immense pressures of an election year to open the floodgates of Federal
         money and the temptation to promise more than I could deliver. I told it
         as it was to the American people and demonstrated to the world that in
         our spirited political competition, as in this chamber, Americans can
         disagree without being disagreeable.</p>
      <p>Now, after 30 months as your President, I can say that while we still
         have a way to go, I am proud of the long way we have come together.</p>
      <p>I am proud of the part I have had in rebuilding confidence in the
         Presidency, confidence in our free system, and confidence in our future.
         Once again, Americans believe in themselves, in their leaders, and in
         the promise that tomorrow holds for their children.</p>
      <p><span class="war">I am proud that today America is at peace. None of our sons are fighting
            and dying in battle anywhere in the world. And the chance for peace
            among all nations is improved by our determination to honor our vital
            commitments in defense of peace and freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I am proud that the United States has strong defenses, strong alliances,
            and a sound and courageous foreign policy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our alliances with major partners, the great industrial democracies of
            Western Europe, Japan, and Canada, have never been more solid.</span>
         <span class="war">Consultations on mutual security, defense, and East-West relations have
            grown closer.</span> <span class="infra"><span class="economy">Collaboration has branched out into new fields such as
               energy, economic policy, and relations with the Third World.</span> We have
            used many avenues for cooperation, including summit meetings held among
            major allied countries. The friendship of the democracies is deeper,
            warmer, and more effective than at any time in 30 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">We are maintaining stability in the strategic nuclear balance and
               pushing back the specter of nuclear war. A decisive step forward was
               taken in the Vladivostok Accord which I negotiated with General
               Secretary Brezhnev--joint recognition that an equal ceiling should be
               placed on the number of strategic weapons on each side. With resolve and
               wisdom on the part of both nations, a good agreement is well within
               reach this year.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The framework for peace in the Middle East has been built. Hopes for
            future progress in the Middle East were stirred by the historic
            agreements we reached and the trust and confidence that we formed.
            Thanks to American leadership, the prospects for peace in the Middle
            East are brighter than they have been in three decades. The Arab states
            and Israel continue to look to us to lead them from confrontation and
            war to a new era of accommodation and peace. We have no alternative but
            to persevere, and I am sure we will. The opportunities for a final
            settlement are great, and the price of failure is a return to the
            bloodshed and hatred that for too long have brought tragedy to all of
            the peoples of this area and repeatedly edged the world to the brink of
            war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is proving its
            importance and its durability. We are finding more and more common
            ground between our two countries on basic questions of international
            affairs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In my two trips to Asia as President, we have reaffirmed America's
            continuing vital interest in the peace and security of Asia and the
            Pacific Basin, established a new partnership with Japan, confirmed our
            dedication to the security of Korea, and reinforced our ties with the
            free nations of Southeast Asia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">An historic dialog has begun between industrial nations and developing
            nations. Most proposals on the table are the initiatives of the United
            States, including those on food, energy, technology, trade, investment,
            and commodities. <span class="economy">We are well launched on this process of shaping
               positive and reliable economic relations between rich nations and poor
               nations over the long term.</span></span></p>
      <p>We have made progress in trade negotiations and avoided protectionism
         during recession. <span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">We strengthened the international monetary system.
               During the past 2 years the free world's most important economic powers
               have already brought about important changes that serve both developed
               and developing economies.</span></span> The momentum already achieved must be nurtured
         and strengthened, <span class="poverty">for the prosperity of the rich and poor depends upon
            it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Latin America, our relations have taken on a new maturity and a sense
            of common enterprise.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In Africa the quest for peace, racial justice, and economic progress is
            at a crucial point. The United States, in close cooperation with the
            United Kingdom, is actively engaged in this historic process. Will
            change come about by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention? Or will
            it come about by negotiated and fair solutions, ensuring majority rule,
            minority rights, and economic advance? America is committed to the side
            of peace and justice and to the principle that Africa should shape its
            own future, free of outside intervention.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">American leadership has helped to stimulate new international efforts to
            stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a comprehensive
            treaty governing the use of oceans.</span></p>
      <p>I am gratified by these accomplishments. They constitute a record of
         broad success for America and for the peace and prosperity of all
         mankind. This administration leaves to its successor a world in better
         condition than we found. We leave, as well, a solid foundation for
         progress on a range of issues that are vital to the well-being of
         America.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">What has been achieved in the field of foreign affairs and what can be
            accomplished by the new administration demonstrate the genius of
            Americans working together for the common good.</span> It is this, our
         remarkable ability to work together, that has made us a unique nation.
         It is Congress, the President, and the people striving for a better
         world.</p>
      <p>I know all patriotic Americans want this Nation's foreign policy to
         succeed. I urge members of my party in this Congress to give the new
         President loyal support in this area. <span class="economy">I express the hope that this new
            Congress will reexamine its constitutional role in international
            affairs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The exclusive right to declare war, the duty to advise and consent on
            the part of the Senate, the power of the purse on the part of the House
            are ample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously
            guarded.</span> But because we may have been too careless of these powers in
         the past does not justify congressional intrusion into, or obstruction
         of, the proper exercise of Presidential responsibilities now or in the
         future. There can be only one Commander in Chief. In these times crises
         cannot be managed and wars cannot be waged by committee, nor can peace
         be pursued solely by parliamentary debate. To the ears of the world, the
         President speaks for the Nation. While he is, of course, ultimately
         accountable to the Congress, the courts, and the people, he and his
         emissaries must not be handicapped in advance in their relations with
         foreign governments as has sometimes happened in the past.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">At home I am encouraged by the Nation's recovery from the recession and
            our steady return to sound economic growth. It is now continuing after
            the recent period of uncertainty, which is part of the price we pay for
            free elections.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our most pressing need today and the future is more jobs--productive,
            permanent jobs created by a thriving economy. We must revise our tax
            system both to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the
            investment necessary for the creation of productive jobs for all
            Americans who want to work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Earlier this month I proposed a permanent income tax reduction of $10
            billion below current levels, including raising the personal exemption
            from $750 to $1,000. I also recommended a series of measures to
            stimulate investment, such as accelerated depreciation for new plants
            and equipment in areas of high unemployment, a reduction in the
            corporate tax rate from 48 to 46 percent, and eliminating the present
            double taxation of dividends. I strongly urge the Congress to pass these
            measures to help create the productive, permanent jobs in the private
            economy that are so essential for our future.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">All the basic trends are good; we are not on the brink of another
            recession or economic disaster. If we follow prudent policies that
            encourage productive investment and discourage destructive inflation, we
            will come out on top, and I am sure we will.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have successfully cut inflation by more than half. When I took
            office, the Consumer Price Index was rising at 12.2 percent a year.
            During 1976 the rate of inflation was 5 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have created more jobs--over 4 million more jobs today than in the
            spring of 1975. Throughout this Nation today we have over 88 million
            people in useful, productive jobs--more than at any other time in our
            Nation's history.</span> <span class="poverty">But there are still too many Americans unemployed.</span>
         This is the greatest regret that I have as I leave office.</p>
      <p>We brought about with the Congress, after much delay, the renewal of the
         general revenue sharing. We expanded community development and Federal
         manpower programs. <span class="infra">We began a significant urban mass transit program.</span>
         <span class="poverty">Federal programs today provide more funds for our States and local
            governments than ever before--$70 billion for the current fiscal year.
            Through these programs and others that provide aid directly to
            individuals, we have kept faith with our tradition of compassionate help
            for those who need it. As we begin our third century we can be proud of
            the progress that we have made in meeting human needs for all of our
            citizens.</span></p>
      <p>We have cut the growth of crime by nearly 90 percent. Two years ago
         crime was increasing at the rate of 18 percent annually. In the first
         three quarters of 1976, that growth rate had been cut to 2 percent. But
         crime, and the fear of crime, remains one of the most serious problems
         facing our citizens.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">We have had some successes, and there have been some disappointments.
            Bluntly, I must remind you that we have not made satisfactory progress
            toward achieving energy independence. Energy is absolutely vital to the
            <span class="war">defense of our country,</span> <span class="economy">to the strength of our economy,</span> and to the
            quality of our lives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Two years ago I proposed to the Congress the first comprehensive
            national energy program--a specific and coordinated set of measures that
            would end our vulnerability to embargo, blockade, or arbitrary price
            increases and would mobilize U.S. technology and resources to supply a
            significant share of the free world's energy after 1985. Of the major
            energy proposals I submitted 2 years ago, only half, belatedly, became
            law. In 1973 we were dependent upon foreign oil imports for 36 percent
            of our needs. Today, we are 40-percent dependent, and we'll pay out $34
            billion for foreign oil this year. Such vulnerability at present or in
            the future is intolerable and must be ended.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">The answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today reminds
            me of the old argument about whether the tank is half full or half
            empty. The pessimist will say we have half failed to achieve our 10-year
            energy goals; the optimist will say that we have half succeeded.</span> I am
         always an optimist, but we must make up for lost time.</p>
      <p>We have laid a solid foundation for completing the enormous task which
         confronts us. <span class="infra">I have signed into law five major energy bills which
            contain significant measures for conservation, resource development,
            stockpiling, and standby authorities. We have moved forward to develop
            the naval petroleum reserves; to build a 500-million barrel strategic
            petroleum stockpile; to phase out unnecessary Government allocation and
            price controls; <span class="diplomacy">to develop a lasting relationship with other oil
               consuming nations; to improve the efficiency of energy use through
               conservation in automobiles, buildings, and industry; and to expand
               research on new technology and renewable resources such as wind power,
               geothermal and solar energy.</span></span> All these actions, significant as they are
         for the long term, are only the beginning.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">I recently submitted to the Congress my proposals to reorganize the
            Federal energy structure and the hard choices which remain if we are
            serious about reducing our dependence upon foreign energy. These include
            programs to reverse our declining production of natural gas and increase
            incentives for domestic crude oil production. I proposed to minimize
            environmental uncertainties affecting coal development, expand nuclear
            power generation, and create an energy independence authority to provide
            government financial assistance for vital energy programs where private
            capital is not available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs
            when our current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to
            dwindle in the next decade. I urgently ask Congress and the new
            administration to move quickly on these issues. This Nation has the
            resources and the capability to achieve our energy goals if its
            Government has the will to proceed, and I think we do.</span></p>
      <p>I have been disappointed by inability to complete many of the meaningful
         organizational reforms which I contemplated for the Federal Government,
         although a start has been made. For example, the Federal judicial system
         has long served as a model for other courts. But today it is threatened
         by a shortage of qualified Federal judges and an explosion of litigation
         claiming Federal jurisdiction. I commend to the new administration and
         the Congress the recent report and recommendations of the Department of
         Justice, undertaken at my request, on "the needs of the Federal Courts."
         I especially endorse its proposals for a new commission on the judicial
         appointment process.</p>
      <p>While the judicial branch of our Government may require reinforcement,
         the budgets and payrolls of the other branches remain staggering. I
         cannot help but observe that while the White House staff and the
         Executive Office of the President have been reduced and the total number
         of civilians in the executive branch contained during the 1970's, the
         legislative branch has increased substantially although the membership
         of the Congress remains at 535. <span class="economy">Congress now costs the taxpayers more
            than a million dollars per Member; the whole legislative budget has
            passed the billion dollar mark.</span></p>
      <p>We have made some progress in cutting back the expansion of government
         and its intrusion into individual lives, but believe me, there is much
         more to be done--and you and I know it. It can only be done by tough and
         temporarily painful surgery by a Congress as prepared as the President
         to face up to this very real political problem. Again, I wish my
         successor, working with a substantial majority of his own party, the
         best of success in reforming the costly and cumbersome machinery of the
         Federal Government.</p>
      <p>The task of self-government is never finished. The problems are great;
         the opportunities are greater.</p>
      <p>America's first goal is and always will be peace with honor. <span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">America
               must remain first in keeping peace in the world. We can remain first in
               peace only if we are never second in defense.</span></span></p>
      <p>In presenting the state of the Union to the Congress and to the American
         people, <span class="war">I have a special obligation as Commander in Chief to report on
            our national defense. Our survival as a free and independent people
            requires, above all, strong military forces that are well equipped and
            highly trained to perform their assigned mission.</span></p>
      <p>I am particularly gratified to report that over the past 2 1/2 years, <span class="war">we
            have been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade
            in real resources this country was devoting to national defense. This
            was an immediate problem I faced in 1974. The evidence was unmistakable
            that the Soviet Union had been steadily increasing the resources it
            applied to building its military strength. During this same period the
            United States real defense spending declined.</span> In my three budgets we not
         only arrested that dangerous decline, but we have established the
         positive trend which is essential to our ability to contribute to peace
         and stability in the world.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The Vietnam war, both materially and psychologically, affected our
            overall defense posture. The dangerous anti-military sentiment
            discouraged defense spending and unfairly disparaged the men and women
            who serve in our Armed Forces.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The challenge that now confronts this country is whether we have the
            national will and determination to continue this essential defense
            effort over the long term, as it must be continued.</span> We can no longer
         afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter; indeed, we
         have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budgets and to
         examine the nature of the problem we will face over the next generation.</p>
      <p>I am the first recent President able to address long-term, basic issues
         without the burden of Vietnam. <span class="war">The war in Indochina consumed enormous
            resources at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority
            we once enjoyed was disappearing.</span> In past years, as a result of
         decisions by the United States, our strategic forces leveled off, yet
         the Soviet Union continued a steady, constant buildup of its own forces,
         committing a high percentage of its national economic effort to defense.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The United States can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance
            against us or even a situation where the American people or our allies
            believe the balance is shifting against us. The United States would risk
            the most serious political consequences if the world came to believe
            that our adversaries have a decisive margin of superiority.</span></p>
      <p>To maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the 1980's and
         beyond. <span class="war">The sophistication of modern weapons requires that we make
            decisions now if we are to ensure our security 10 years from now.
            Therefore, I have consistently advocated and strongly urged that we
            pursue three critical strategic programs: the Trident missile launching
            submarine; the B-1 bomber, with its superior capability to penetrate
            modern air defenses; and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic
            missile that will be better able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a
            devastating retaliatory strike.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In an era where the strategic nuclear forces are in rough equilibrium,
            the risks of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more
            perilous.</span> A major, long-term objective, therefore, is to maintain
         capabilities to deal with, and thereby deter, conventional challenges
         and crises, particularly in Europe.</p>
      <p>We cannot rely solely on strategic forces to guarantee our security or
         to deter all types of aggression. <span class="war">We must have superior naval and marine
            forces to maintain freedom of the seas, strong multipurpose tactical air
            forces, and mobile, modern ground forces.</span> <span class="diplomacy">Accordingly, I have directed a
            long-term effort to improve our worldwide capabilities to deal with
            regional crises.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I have submitted a 5-year naval building program indispensable to the
            Nation's maritime strategy. Because the security of Europe and the
            integrity of NATO remain the cornerstone of American defense policy,</span> I
         have initiated a special, long-term program to ensure the capacity of
         the Alliance to deter or defeat aggression in Europe.</p>
      <p><span class="war">As I leave office I can report that our national defense is effectively
            deterring conflict today. Our Armed Forces are capable of carrying out
            the variety of missions assigned to them. Programs are underway which
            will assure we can deter war in the years ahead. But I also must warn
            that it will require a sustained effort over a period of years to
            maintain these capabilities.</span> We must have the wisdom, the stamina, and
         the courage to prepare today for the perils of tomorrow, and I believe
         we will.</p>
      <p>As I look to the future--and I assure you I intend to go on doing that
         for a good many years--I can say with confidence that the state of the
         Union is good, but we must go on making it better and better.</p>
      <p>This gathering symbolizes the constitutional foundation which makes
         continued progress possible, synchronizing the skills of three
         independent branches of Government, reserving fundamental sovereignty to
         the people of this great land. It is only as the temporary
         representatives and servants of the people that we meet here, we bring
         no hereditary status or gift of infallibility, and none follows us from
         this place.</p>
      <p>Like President Washington, like the more fortunate of his successors, I
         look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and
         gratitude. To me, being a citizen of the United States of America is the
         greatest honor and privilege in this world.</p>
      <p>From the opportunities which fate and my fellow citizens have given me,
         as a Member of the House, as Vice President and President of the Senate,
         and as President of all the people, I have come to understand and place
         the highest value on the checks and balances which our founders imposed
         on government through the separation of powers among co-equal
         legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This often results in
         difficulty and delay, as I well know, but it also places supreme
         authority under God, beyond any one person, any one branch, any majority
         great or small, or any one party. The Constitution is the bedrock of all
         our freedoms. Guard and cherish it, keep honor and order in your own
         house, and the Republic will endure.</p>
      <p>It is not easy to end these remarks. In this Chamber, along with some of
         you, I have experienced many, many of the highlights of my life. It was
         here that I stood 28 years ago with my freshman colleagues, as Speaker
         Sam Rayburn administered the oath. I see some of you now--Charlie
         Bennett, Dick Bolling, Carl Perkins, Pete Rodino, Harley Staggers, Tom
         Steed, Sid Yates, Clem Zablocki-and I remember those who have gone to
         their rest. It was here we waged many, many a lively battle--won some,
         lost some, but always remaining friends. It was here, surrounded by such
         friends, that the distinguished Chief Justice swore me in as Vice
         President on December 6, 1973. It was here I returned 8 months later as
         your President to ask not for a honeymoon, but for a good marriage.</p>
      <p>I will always treasure those memories and your many, many kindnesses. I
         thank you for them all.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, I once asked you for your prayers, and now I give
         you mine: May God guide this wonderful country, its people, and those
         they have chosen to lead them. May our third century be illuminated by
         liberty and blessed with brotherhood, so that we and all who come after
         us may be the humble servants of thy peace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Good night. God bless you.

      <h3>January 19, 1978</h3>
      <p>Two years ago today we had the first caucus in Iowa, and one year ago
         tomorrow, I walked from here to the White House to take up the duties of
         President of the United States. I didn't know it then when I walked, but
         I've been trying to save energy ever since.</p>
      <p>I return tonight to fulfill one of those duties of the Constitution: to
         give to the Congress, and to the Nation, information on the state of the
         Union.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">Militarily, politically, economically, and in spirit, the state of our
               Union is sound.</span></span></p>
      <p>We are a great country, a strong country, a vital and dynamic country,
         and so we will remain.</p>
      <p>We are a confident people and a hardworking people, a decent and a
         compassionate people, and so we will remain.</p>
      <p>I want to speak to you tonight about where we are and where we must go,
         about what we have done and what we must do. And I want to pledge to you
         my best efforts and ask you to pledge yours.</p>
      <p>Each generation of Americans has to face circumstances not of its own
         choosing, but by which its character is measured and its spirit is
         tested.</p>
      <p>There are times of emergency, when a nation and its leaders must bring
         their energies to bear on a single urgent task. That was the duty
         Abraham Lincoln faced when our land was torn apart by conflict in the
         War Between the States. That was the duty faced by Franklin Roosevelt
         when he led America out of an economic depression and again when he led
         America to victory in war.</p>
      <p>There are other times when there is no single overwhelming crisis, yet
         profound national interests are at stake.</p>
      <p>At such times the risk of inaction can be equally great. It becomes the
         task of leaders to call forth the vast and restless energies of our
         people to build for the future.</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">That is what Harry Truman did in the years after the Second World War,
               when we helped Europe and Japan rebuild themselves and secured an
               international order that has protected freedom from aggression.</span></span></p>
      <p>We live in such times now, and we face such duties.</p>
      <p>We've come through a long period of turmoil and doubt, but we've once
         again found our moral course, and with a new spirit, we are striving to
         express our best instincts to the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>There is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of
         common purpose. This sense of unity cannot be expressed in programs or
         in legislation or in dollars. It's an achievement that belongs to every
         individual American. This unity ties together, and it towers over all
         our efforts here in Washington, and it serves as an inspiring beacon for
         all of us who are elected to serve.</p>
      <p>This new atmosphere demands a new spirit, a partnership between those of
         us who lead and those who elect. The foundations of this partnership are
         truth, the courage to face hard decisions, concern for one another and
         the common good over special interests, and a basic faith and trust in
         the wisdom and strength and judgment of the American people.</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">For the first time in a generation, we are not haunted by a major
               international crisis or by domestic turmoil, and we now have a rare and
               a priceless opportunity to address persistent problems and burdens which
               come to us as a nation, quietly and steadily getting worse over the
               years.</span></span></p>
      <p>As President, I've had to ask you, the Members of Congress, and you, the
         American people, to come to grips with some of the most difficult and
         hard questions facing our society.</p>
      <p>We must make a maximum effort, because if we do not aim for the best, we
         are very likely to achieve little. I see no benefit to the country if we
         delay, because the problems will only get worse.</p>
      <p>We need patience and good will, but we really need to realize that there
         is a limit to the role and the function of government. Government cannot
         solve our problems, it can't set our goals, it cannot define our vision.
         <span class="poverty">Government cannot eliminate poverty or <span class="economy">provide a bountiful economy or
               reduce inflation or save our cities or cure illiteracy or provide
               energy.</span></span> And government cannot mandate goodness. Only a true partnership
         between government and the people can ever hope to reach these goals.</p>
      <p>Those of us who govern can sometimes inspire, and we can identify needs
         and marshal resources, but we simply cannot be the managers of
         everything and everybody.</p>
      <p>We here in Washington must move away from crisis management, and we must
         establish clear goals for the future, immediate and the distant future,
         which will let us work together and not in conflict. <span class="infra">Never again should
            we neglect a growing crisis like the shortage of energy,</span> where further
         delay will only lead to more harsh and painful solutions.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Every day we spend more than $120 million for foreign oil.</span> <span class="economy">This slows
            our economic growth, it lowers the value of the dollar overseas, and it
            aggravates unemployment and inflation here at home.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Now we know what we must do, increase production. We must cut down on
            waste. And we must use more of those fuels which are plentiful and more
            permanent.</span> <span class="economy">We must be fair to people, and we must not disrupt our
            Nation's economy and our budget.</span></p>
      <p>Now, that sounds simple. But I recognize the difficulties involved. I
         know that it is not easy for the Congress to act. <span class="infra">But the fact remains
            that on the energy legislation, we have failed the American people.
            Almost 5 years after the oil embargo dramatized the problem for us all,
            we still do not have a national energy program.</span> Not much longer can we
         tolerate this stalemate. It undermines our national interest both at
         home and abroad. We must succeed, and I believe we will.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">Our main task at home this year, with energy a central element, is the
               Nation's economy.</span> We must continue the recovery and <span class="poverty">further cut
               unemployment and inflation.</span></span></p>
      <p>Last year was a good one for the United States. <span class="economy">We reached all of our
            major economic goals for 1977. Four million new jobs were created, an
            alltime record, and the number of unemployed dropped by more than a
            million. Unemployment right now is the lowest it has been since 1974,
            and not since World War II has such a high percentage of American people
            been employed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The rate of inflation went down. There was a good growth in business
            profits and investments, the source of more jobs for our workers, and a
            higher standard of living for all our people. After taxes and inflation,
            there was a healthy increase in workers' wages.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And this year, our country will have the first $2 trillion economy in
            the history of the world.</span></p>
      <p>Now, we are proud of this progress the first year, but we must do even
         better in the future.</p>
      <p>We still have serious problems on which all of us must work together.
         <span class="economy">Our trade deficit is too large. Inflation is still too high, <span class="poverty">and too
               many Americans still do not have a job.</span></span></p>
      <p>Now, I didn't have any simple answers for all these problems. <span class="economy">But we
            have developed an economic policy that is working, because it's simple,
            balanced, and fair. It's based on four principles: First, the economy
            must keep on expanding to produce new jobs and better income, which our
            people need. The fruits of growth must be widely shared. More jobs must
            be made available to those who have been bypassed until now. And the tax
            system must be made fairer and simpler.</span></p>
      <p>Secondly, private business and not the Government must lead the
         expansion in the future.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Third, we must lower the rate of inflation and keep it down. Inflation
            slows down economic growth, and <span class="poverty">it's the most cruel to the poor and also
               to the elderly and others who live on fixed incomes.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">And fourth, we must contribute to the strength of the world economy.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I will announce detailed proposals for improving our tax system later
            this week. We can make our tax laws fairer, we can make them simpler and
            easier to understand, and at the same time, we can, and we will, reduce
            the tax burden on American citizens by $25 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The tax reforms and the tax reductions go together. Only with the long
            overdue reforms will the full tax cut be advisable.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Almost $17 billion in income tax cuts will go to individuals. Ninety-six
            percent of all American taxpayers will see their taxes go down. For a
            typical family of four, this means an annual saving of more than $250 a
            year, or a tax reduction of about 20 percent. A further $2 billion cut
            in excise taxes will give more relief and also contribute directly to
            lowering the rate of inflation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And we will also provide strong additional incentives for business
            investment and growth through substantial cuts in the corporate tax
            rates and improvement in the investment tax credit.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, these tax proposals will increase opportunity everywhere in the
            Nation. <span class="poverty">But additional jobs for the disadvantaged deserve special
               attention.</span></span></p>
      <p>We've already passed laws to assure equal access to the voting booth and
         to restaurants and to schools, to housing, and laws to permit access to
         jobs. <span class="poverty">But job opportunity, the chance to earn a decent living, is also a
            basic human right, which we cannot and will not ignore.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">A major priority for our Nation is the final elimination of the barriers
            that restrict the opportunities available to women and also to black
            people and Hispanics and other minorities. We've come a long way toward
            that goal. But there is still much to do. What we inherited from the
            past must not be permitted to shackle us in the future.</span></p>
      <p>I'll be asking you for a substantial increase in funds for public jobs
         for our young people, and I also am recommending that the Congress
         continue the public service employment programs at more than twice the
         level of a year ago. When welfare reform is completed, we will have more
         than a million additional jobs so that those on welfare who are able to
         work can work.</p>
      <p>However, again, we know that in our free society, private business is
         still the best source of new jobs. Therefore, I will propose a new
         program to encourage businesses to hire young and disadvantaged
         Americans. <span class="economy">These young people only need skills and a chance in order to
            take their place in our economic system. Let's give them the chance they
            need.</span> A major step in the right direction would be the early passage of
         a greatly improved Humphrey-Hawkins bill.</p>
      <p>My budget for 1979 addresses these national needs, but it is lean and
         tight. I have cut waste wherever possible.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I am proposing an increase of less than 2 percent after adjusting for
            inflation, the smallest increase in the Federal budget in 4 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Lately, Federal spending has taken a steadily increasing portion of what
            Americans produce. Our new budget reverses that trend, and later I hope
            to bring the Government's toll down even further. And with your help,
            we'll do that.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In time of high employment and a strong economy, deficit spending should
            not be a feature of our budget. As the economy continues to gain
            strength and as our unemployment rates continue to fall, revenues will
            grow.</span> With careful planning, efficient management, and proper restraint
         on spending, we can move rapidly toward a balanced budget, and we will.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Next year the budget deficit will be only slightly less than this year.
            But one-third of the deficit is due to the necessary tax cuts that I've
            proposed. This year the right choice is to reduce the burden on
            taxpayers and provide more jobs for our people.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The third element in our program is a renewed attack on inflation. We've
            learned the hard way that high unemployment will not prevent or cure
            inflation. Government can help us by stimulating private investment and
            by maintaining a responsible economic policy. Through a new top-level
            review process, we will do a better job of reducing Government
            regulation that drives up costs and drives up prices.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">But again, Government alone cannot bring down the rate of inflation.
            When a level of high inflation is expected to continue, then companies
            raise prices to protect their profit margins against prospective
            increases in wages and other costs, while workers demand higher wages as
            protection against expected price increases.</span> It's like an escalation in
         the arms race, and understandably, no one wants to disarm alone.</p>
      <p>Now, no one firm or a group of workers can halt this process. It's an
         effort that we must all make together. <span class="economy">I'm therefore asking government,
            business, labor, and other groups to join in a voluntary program to
            moderate inflation by holding wage and price increases in each sector of
            the economy during 1978 below the average increases of the last 2 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I do not believe in wage and price controls. A sincere commitment to
            voluntary constraint provides a way, perhaps the only way, to fight
            inflation without Government interference.</span></p>
      <p>As I came into the Capitol tonight, I saw the farmers, my fellow
         farmers, standing out in the snow. I'm familiar with their problem, and
         I know from Congress' action that you are too. When I was running
         Carters Warehouse, we had spread on our own farms 5-10-15 fertilizer for
         about $40 a ton. The last time I was home, the price was about $100 a
         ton. The cost of nitrogen has gone up 150 percent, and the price of
         products that farmers sell has either stayed the same or gone down a
         little.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Now, this past year in 1977, you, the Congress, and I together passed a
            new agricultural act. It went into effect October 1. It'll have its
            first impact on the 1978 crops. It will help a great deal. It'll add $6
            1/2 billion or more to help the farmers with their price supports and
            target prices.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Last year we had the highest level of exports of farm products in the
            history of our country, $24 billion.</span> We expect to have more this year.
         We'll be working together. But I think it's incumbent on us to monitor
         very carefully the farm situation and continue to work harmoniously with
         the farmers of our country. What's best for the farmers, the farm
         families, in the long run is also best for the consumers of our country.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">Economic success at home is also the key to success in our international
               economic policy. <span class="infra">An effective energy program, strong investment and
                  productivity, and controlled inflation will provide [improve] our trade
                  balance and balance it, and it will help to protect the integrity of the
                  dollar overseas.</span></span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">By working closely with our friends abroad, <span class="economy">we can promote the economic
               health of the whole world, with fair and balanced agreements lowering
               the barriers to trade.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">Despite the inevitable pressures that build up when the world economy
               suffers from high unemployment, we must firmly resist the demands for
               self-defeating protectionism. But free trade must also be fair trade.
               And I am determined to protect American industry and American workers
               against foreign trade practices which are unfair or illegal.</span></span></p>
      <p>In a separate written message to Congress, I've outlined other domestic
         initiatives, such as welfare reform, consumer protection, basic
         education skills, urban policy, reform of our labor laws, and national
         health care later on this year. I will not repeat these tonight. But
         there are several other points that I would like to make directly to
         you.</p>
      <p>During these past years, Americans have seen our Government grow far
         from us.</p>
      <p>For some citizens, the Government has almost become like a foreign
         country, so strange and distant that we've often had to deal with it
         through trained ambassadors who have sometimes become too powerful and
         too influential, lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists. This cannot go on.</p>
      <p>We must have what Abraham Lincoln wanted, a government for the people.</p>
      <p>We've made progress toward that kind of government. You've given me the
         authority I requested to reorganize the Federal bureaucracy. And I am
         using that authority.</p>
      <p>We've already begun a series of reorganization plans which will be
         completed over a period of 3 years. We have also proposed abolishing
         almost 500 Federal advisory and other commissions and boards. But I know
         that the American people are still sick and tired of Federal paperwork
         and redtape. Bit by bit we are chopping down the thicket of unnecessary
         Federal regulations by which Government too often interferes in our
         personal lives and our personal business. We've cut the public's Federal
         paperwork load by more than 12 percent in less than a year. And we are
         not through cutting.</p>
      <p>We've made a good start on turning the gobbledygook of Federal
         regulations into plain English that people can understand. But we know
         that we still have a long way to go.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">We've brought together parts of 11 Government agencies to create a new
            Department of Energy.</span> And now it's time to take another major step by
         creating a separate Department of Education.</p>
      <p>But even the best organized Government will only be as effective as the
         people who carry out its policies. For this reason, I consider civil
         service reform to be absolutely vital. Worked out with the civil
         servants themselves, this reorganization plan will restore the merit
         principle to a system which has grown into a bureaucratic maze. It will
         provide greater management flexibility and better rewards for better
         performance without compromising job security.</p>
      <p>Then and only then can we have a government that is efficient, open, and
         truly worthy of our people's understanding and respect. I have promised
         that we will have such a government, and I intend to keep that promise.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In our foreign policy, the separation of people from government has been
            in the past a source of weakness and error. In a democratic system like
            ours, foreign policy decisions must be able to stand the test of public
            examination and public debate.</span> If we make a mistake in this
         administration, it will be on the side of frankness and openness with
         the American people.</p>
      <p>In our modern world, when the deaths of literally millions of people can
         result from a few terrifying seconds of destruction, <span class="war">the path of
            national strength and security is identical to the path of peace.</span></p>
      <p>Tonight, I am happy to report that because we are strong, our Nation is
         at peace with the world.</p>
      <p>We are a confident nation. We've restored a moral basis for our foreign
         policy. The very heart of our identity as a nation is our firm
         commitment to human rights.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We stand for human rights because we believe that government has as a
            purpose to promote the well-being of its citizens.</span> <span class="diplomacy">This is true in our
            domestic policy; it's also true in our foreign policy. The world must
            know that in support of human rights, the United States will stand firm.</span></p>
      <p>We expect no quick or easy results, but there has been significant
         movement toward greater freedom and humanity in several parts of the
         world.</p>
      <p>Thousands of political prisoners have been freed. The leaders of the
         world, even our ideological adversaries, now see that their attitude
         toward fundamental human rights affects their standing in the
         international community, and it affects their relations with the United
         States.</p>
      <p>To serve the interests of every American, our foreign policy has three
         major goals.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The first and prime concern is and will remain the security of our
            country.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Security is based on our national will, and security is based on the
            strength of our Armed Forces. We have the will, and militarily we are
            very strong.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">Security also comes through the strength of our alliances. We have
               reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of Europe, and this year we
               will demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and
               strengthening our military capabilities there.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Security can also be enhanced by agreements with potential adversaries
            which reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintaining our own
            relative strategic capability.</span></p>
      <p>In areas of peaceful competition with the Soviet Union, we will continue
         to more than hold our own.</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">At the same time, we are negotiating with quiet confidence, without
               haste, with careful determination, to ease the tensions between us and
               to ensure greater stability and security.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The strategic arms limitation talks have been long and difficult. We
            want a mutual limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant
            nuclear arsenals of both nations, and then we want actual reductions in
            strategic arms as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of
            nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">If these talks result in an agreement this year, and I trust they will,
            I pledge to you that the agreement will maintain and enhance the
            stability of the world's strategic balance and the security of the
            United States.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">For 30 years, concerted but unsuccessful efforts have been made to ban
            the testing of atomic explosives, both military weapons and peaceful
            nuclear devices.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">We are hard at work with Great Britain and the Soviet Union on an
               agreement which will stop testing and will protect our national security
               and provide for adequate verification of compliance.</span> We are now making,
            I believe, good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear
            explosions.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are also working vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear
            weapons among the nations of the world which do not now have them and to
            reduce the deadly global traffic in conventional arms sales.</span> Our stand
         for peace is suspect if we are also the principal arms merchant of the
         world. So, we've decided to cut down our arms transfers abroad on a
         year-by-year basis and to work with other major arms exporters to
         encourage their similar constraint.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Every American has a stake in our second major goal, a world at peace.
            In a nuclear age, each of us is threatened when peace is not secured
            everywhere. We are trying to promote harmony in those parts of the world
            where major differences exist among other nations and threaten
            international peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the Middle East, we are contributing our good offices to maintain the
            momentum of the current negotiations and to keep open the lines of
            communication among the Middle Eastern leaders.</span> The whole world has a
         great stake in the success of these efforts. This is a precious
         opportunity for a historic settlement of a longstanding conflict, an
         opportunity which may never come again in our lifetime.</p>
      <p>Our role has been difficult and sometimes thankless and controversial.
         But it has been constructive and it has been necessary, and it will
         continue.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">Our third major foreign policy goal is one that touches the life of
               every American citizen every day, world economic growth and stability.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">This requires strong economic performance by the industrialized
               democracies like ourselves and progress in resolving the global energy
               crisis.</span> Last fall, with the help of others, we succeeded in our vigorous
            efforts to maintain the stability of the price of oil. But as many
            foreign leaders have emphasized to me personally and, I am sure, to you,
            the greatest future contribution that America can make to the world
            economy would be an effective energy conservation program here at home.
            We will not hesitate to take the actions needed to protect the integrity
            of the American dollar.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are trying to develop a more just international system. And in this
            spirit, we are supporting the struggle for human development in Africa,
            in Asia, and in Latin America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Finally, the world is watching to see how we act on one of our most
            important and controversial items of business, approval of the Panama
            Canal treaties.</span> The treaties now before the Senate are the result of the
         work of four administrations, two Democratic, two Republican.</p>
      <p>They guarantee that the canal will be open always for unrestricted use
         by the ships of the world. Our ships have the right to go to the head of
         the line for priority of passage in times of emergency or need. We
         retain the permanent right to defend the canal with our own military
         forces, if necessary, to guarantee its openness and its neutrality.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The treaties are to the clear advantage of ourselves, the Panamanians,
            and the other users of the canal. Ratifying the Panama Canal treaties
            will demonstrate our good faith to the world, discourage the spread of
            hostile ideologies in this hemisphere, <span class="economy">and directly contribute to the
               economic well-being and the security of the United States.</span></span></p>
      <p>I have to say that that's very welcome applause.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">There were two moments on my recent journey which, for me, confirmed the
            final aims of our foreign policy and what it always must be.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">One was in a little village in India, where I met a people as
            passionately attached to their rights and liberties as we are, but whose
            children have a far smaller chance for good health or food or education
            or human fulfillment than a child born in this country.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">The other moment was in Warsaw, capital of a nation twice devastated by
               war in this century. There, people have rebuilt the city which war's
               destruction took from them. But what was new only emphasized clearly
               what was lost.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">What I saw in those two places crystalized for me the purposes of our
            own Nation's policy: to ensure economic justice, <span class="civil-rights">to advance human
               rights, to resolve conflicts without violence, and to proclaim in our
               great democracy our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human
               beings everywhere.</span></span></p>
      <p>We Americans have a great deal of work to do together. In the end, how
         well we do that work will depend on the spirit in which we approach it.
         We must seek fresh answers, unhindered by the stale prescriptions of the
         past.</p>
      <p>It has been said that our best years are behind us. But I say again that
         America's best is still ahead. We have emerged from bitter experiences
         chastened but proud, confident once again, ready to face challenges once
         again, and united once again.</p>
      <p>We come together tonight at a solemn time. Last week the Senate lost a
         good and honest man, Lee Metcalf of Montana.</p>
      <p>And today, the flag of the United States flew at half-mast from this
         Capitol and from American installations and ships all over the world, in
         mourning for Senator Hubert Humphrey.</p>
      <p>Because he exemplified so well the joy and the zest of living, his death
         reminds us not so much of our own mortality, but of the possibilities
         offered to us by life. He always looked to the future with a special
         American kind of confidence, of hope and enthusiasm. And the best way
         that we can honor him is by following his example.</p>
      <p>Our task, to use the words of Senator Humphrey, is "reconciliation,
         rebuilding, and rebirth."</p>
      <p>Reconciliation of private needs and interests into a higher purpose.</p>
      <p>Rebuilding the old dreams of justice and liberty, and country and
         community.</p>
      <p>Rebirth of our faith in the common good.</p>
      <p>Each of us here tonight, and all who are listening in your homes, must
         rededicate ourselves to serving the common good. We are a community, a
         beloved community, all of us. Our individual fates are linked, our
         futures intertwined. And if we act in that knowledge and in that spirit,
         together, as the Bible says, we can move mountains.</p>
      <p>Thank you very much.

      <h3>January 25, 1979</h3>
      <p>Tonight I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American
         Union--how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a
         prosperous world.</p>
      <p>Our children who will be born this year will come of age in the 21st
         century. What kind of society, what kind of world are we building for
         them? Will we ourselves be at peace? Will our children enjoy a better
         quality of life? Will a strong and united America still be a force for
         freedom and prosperity around the world?</p>
      <p>Tonight, there is every sign that the state of our Union is sound.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our economy offers greater prosperity for more of our people than ever
            before. Real per capita income and real business profits have risen
            substantially in the last 2 years.</span> Farm exports are setting an all-time
         record each year, and farm income last year, net farm income, was up
         more than 25 percent.</p>
      <p>Our liberties are secure. <span class="war">Our military defenses are strong and growing
            stronger. And more importantly, tonight, America--our beloved
            country--is at peace.</span></p>
      <p>Our earliest national commitments, modified and reshaped by succeeding
         generations, have served us well. But the problems that we face today
         are different from those that confronted earlier generations of
         Americans. They are more subtle, more complex, and more interrelated. At
         home, we are recognizing ever more clearly that government alone cannot
         solve these problems. <span class="diplomacy">And abroad, few of them can be solved by the
            United States alone. But Americans as a united people, working with our
            allies and friends, have never been afraid to face problems and to solve
            problems, either here or abroad.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The challenge to us is to build a new and firmer foundation for the
            future--for a sound economy, for a more effective government, for more
            political trust, and for a stable peace--so that the America our
            children inherit will be even stronger and even better than it is today.</span></p>
      <p>We cannot resort to simplistic or extreme solutions which substitute
         myths for common sense.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In our economy, it is a myth that we must choose endlessly between
            inflation and recession. Together, we build the foundation for a strong
            economy, with lower inflation, without contriving either a recession
            with its high unemployment or unworkable, mandatory government controls.</span></p>
      <p>In our government, it is a myth that we must choose between compassion
         and competence. Together, we build the foundation for a government that
         works, and works for people.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In our relations with our potential adversaries, it is a myth that we
            must choose between confrontation and capitulation. Together, we build
            the foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Together, we've already begun to build the foundation for confidence in
            our economic system. During the last 2 years, in bringing our economy
            out of the deepest recession since the 1930's, we've created 7,100,000
            new jobs. <span class="poverty">The unemployment rate has gone down 25 percent. And now we
               must redouble our fight against the persistent inflation that has
               wracked our country for more than a decade.</span></span> That's our important
         domestic issue, and we must do it together.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">We know that inflation is a burden for all Americans, but it's a
               disaster for the poor, the sick, and the old. No American family should
               be forced to choose among food, warmth, health care, or decent housing
               because the cost of any of these basic necessities has climbed out of
               reach.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Three months ago, I outlined to the Nation a balanced anti-inflation
            program that couples responsible government restraint with responsible
            wage and price restraint.</span> It's based upon my knowledge that there is a
         more powerful force than government compulsion--the force created by the
         cooperative efforts of millions of Americans working toward a common
         goal.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Business and labor have been increasingly supportive. It's imperative
            that we in government do our part. We must stop excessive government
            growth, and we must control government spending habits.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I've sent to this Congress a stringent but a fair budget, one that,
            since I ran for President in 1976, will have cut the Federal deficit in
            half. And as a percentage of our gross national product, the deficit
            will have dropped by almost 75 percent.</span></p>
      <p>This Congress had a good record last year, and I now ask the 96th
         Congress to continue this partnership in holding the line on excess
         Federal spending. It will not be easy. But we must be strong, and we
         must be persistent.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This budget is a clear message that, with the help of you and the
            American people, I am determined, as President, to bring inflation under
            control.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The 1980 budget provides enough spending restraint to begin unwinding
            inflation, but enough support for our country to keep American workers
            productive and to encourage the investments that provide new jobs. We
            will continue to mobilize our Nation's resources to reduce our trade
            deficit substantially this year and to maintain the strength of the
            American dollar.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We've demonstrated in this restrained budget that we can build on the
            gains of the past 2 years to provide additional support to educate
            disadvantaged children, to care for the elderly, to provide nutrition
            and legal services for the poor, and to strengthen the economic base of
            our urban communities and, also, our rural areas.</span></p>
      <p>This year, we will take our first steps to develop a national health
         plan.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must never accept a permanent group of unemployed Americans, with no
            hope and no stake in building our society. For those left out of the
            economy because of discrimination, a lack of skills, or poverty, we must
            maintain high levels of training, and we must continue to provide jobs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">A responsible budget is not our only weapon to control inflation. We
            must act now to protect all Americans from health care costs that are
            rising $1 million per hour, 24 hours a day, doubling every 5 years.</span> We
         must take control of the largest contributor to that inflation:
         skyrocketing hospital costs.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">There will be no clearer test of the commitment of this Congress to the
            anti-inflation fight than the legislation that I will submit again this
            year to hold down inflation in hospital care.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Over the next 5 years, my proposals will save Americans a total of $60
            billion, of which $25 billion will be savings to the American taxpayer
            in the Federal budget itself. The American people have waited long
            enough. This year we must act on hospital cost containment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must also fight inflation by improvements and better enforcement of
            our antitrust laws and by reducing government obstacles to competition
            in the private sector.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our
            economy. Through deregulation of the airline industry we've increased
            profits, cut prices for all Americans, and begun--for one of the few
            times in the history of our Nation--to actually dismantle a major
            Federal bureaucracy.</span> <span class="infra">This year, we must begin the effort to reform our
            regulatory processes for the railroad, bus, and the trucking industries.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">America has the greatest economic system in the world. Let's reduce
            government interference and give it a chance to work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I call on Congress to take other anti-inflation action--to expand our
            exports to protect American jobs threatened by unfair trade, to conserve
            energy, to increase production and to speed development of solar power,
            and to reassess our Nation's technological superiority.</span> American workers
         who enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our
         gratitude, but they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance
         proposal that I have already made to the Congress.</p>
      <p>To be successful, we must change our attitudes as well as our policies.
         We cannot afford to live beyond our means. We cannot afford to create
         programs that we can neither manage nor finance, or to waste our natural
         resources, and we cannot tolerate mismanagement and fraud. Above all, we
         must meet the challenges of inflation as a united people.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">With the support of the American people, government in recent decades
            has helped to dismantle racial barriers, <span class="poverty">has provided assistance for the
               jobless and the retired, has fed the hungry, has protected the safety,
               health, and bargaining rights of American workers, and has helped to
               preserve our natural heritage.</span></span></p>
      <p>But it's not enough to have created a lot of government programs. Now we
         must make the good programs more effective and improve or weed out those
         which are wasteful or unnecessary.</p>
      <p>With the support of the Congress, we've begun to reorganize and to get
         control of the bureaucracy. We are reforming the civil service system,
         so that we can recognize and reward those who do a good job and correct
         or remove those who do not.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This year, we must extend major reorganization efforts to education, to
            economic development, and to the management of our natural resources. We
            need to enact a sunshine [sunset] law that when government programs have
            outlived their value, they will automatically be terminated.</span></p>
      <p>There's no such thing as an effective and a noncontroversial
         reorganization and reform. But we know that honest, effective government
         is essential to restore public faith in our public action.</p>
      <p>None of us can be satisfied when two-thirds of the American citizens
         chose not to vote last year in a national election. Too many Americans
         feel powerless against the influence of private lobbying groups and the
         unbelievable flood of private campaign money which threatens our
         electoral process.</p>
      <p>This year, we must regain the public's faith by requiring limited
         financial funds from public funds for congressional election campaigns.
         House bill 1 provides for this public financing of campaigns. And I look
         forward with a great deal of anticipation to signing it at an early
         date.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A strong economy and an effective government will restore confidence in
            America.</span> But the path of the future must be charted in peace. We must
         continue to build a new and a firm foundation for a stable world
         community.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are building that new foundation from a position of national
            strength--the strength of our own defenses, the strength of our
            friendships with other nations, and of our oldest American ideals.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">America's military power is a major force for security and stability in
            the world. <span class="diplomacy">We must maintain our strategic capability and continue the
               progress of the last 2 years with our NATO Allies, with whom we have
               increased our readiness, modernized our equipment, and strengthened our
               defense forces in Europe.</span> I urge you to support the strong defense
            budget which I have proposed to the Congress.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But our national security in this complicated age requires more than
            just military might.</span> In less than a lifetime, world population has more
         than doubled, colonial empires have disappeared, and a hundred new
         nations have been born, <span class="civil-rights">and migration to the world's cities have all
            awakened new yearnings for economic justice and human rights among
            people everywhere.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">This demand for justice and human rights is a wave of the future.</span> In
         such a world, the choice is not which super power will dominate the
         world. None can and none will. The choice instead is between a world of
         anarchy and destruction, or a world of cooperation and peace.</p>
      <p>In such a world, we seek not to stifle inevitable change, but to
         influence its course in helpful and constructive ways that enhance our
         values, our national interests, and the cause of peace.</p>
      <p>Towering over this volatile, changing world, like a thundercloud on a
         summer day, looms the awesome power of nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>We will continue to help shape the forces of change, to anticipate
         emerging problems of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms sales,
         and to use our great strength parts of the world before they erupt and
         spread.</p>
      <p>We have no desire to be the world's policeman. But America does want to
         be the world's peacemaker.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are building the foundation for truly global cooperation, not only
            with Western and industrialized nations but with the developing
            countries as well. Our ties with Japan and our European allies are
            stronger than ever, and so are our friendly relations with the people of
            Latin America, Africa, and the Western Pacific and Asia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We've won new respect in this hemisphere with the Panama Canal treaties.
            <span class="civil-rights">We've gained new trust with the developing world through our opposition
               to racism, our commitment to human rights, and our support for majority
               rule in Africa.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">The multilateral trade negotiations are now reaching a successful
               conclusion, and congressional approval is essential to the economic
               well-being of our own country and of the world.</span></span> This will be one of our
         top priorities in 1979.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are entering a hopeful era in our relations with one-fourth of the
            world's people who live in China. The presence of Vice Premier Deng
            Xiaoping next week will help to inaugurate that new era. And with prompt
            congressional action on authorizing legislation, we will continue our
            commitment to a prosperous, peaceful, and secure life for the people of
            Taiwan.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I'm grateful that in the past year, as in the year before, no American
            has died in combat anywhere in the world. And in Iran, Nicaragua,
            Cyprus, Namibia, and Rhodesia, our country is working for peaceful
            solutions to dangerous conflicts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In the Middle East, under the most difficult circumstances, we have
            sought to help ancient enemies lay aside deep-seated differences that
            have produced four bitter wars in our lifetime.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our firm commitment to Israel's survival and security is rooted in our
            deepest convictions and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to
            our own Nation of a stable Middle East. <span class="diplomacy">To promote peace and
               reconciliation in the region, we must retain the trust and the
               confidence both of Israel and also of the Arab nations that are
               sincerely searching for peace.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I am determined, as President, to use the full, beneficial influence of
            our country so that the precious opportunity for lasting peace between
            Israel and Egypt will not be lost.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The new foundation of international cooperation that we seek excludes no
            nation. Cooperation with the Soviet Union serves the cause of peace, for
            in this nuclear age, world peace must include peace between the super
            powers--and it must mean the control of nuclear arms.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Ten years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union made the historic
            decision to open the strategic arms limitations talks, or SALT. The
            purpose of SALT, then as now, is not to gain a unilateral advantage for
            either nation, but to protect the security of both nations, to reverse
            the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arms race, to preserve
            a stable balance of nuclear forces, and to demonstrate to a concerned
            world that we are determined to help preserve the peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The first SALT agreement was concluded in 1972. And since then, during 6
            years of negotiation by both Republican and Democratic leaders, nearly
            all issues of SALT II have been resolved. If the Soviet Union continues
            to negotiate in good faith, a responsible SALT agreement will be
            reached.</span></p>
      <p>It's important that the American people understand the nature of the
         SALT process.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">SALT II is not based on sentiment; it's based on self-interest--of the
            United States and of the Soviet Union. <span class="war">Both nations share a powerful
               common interest in reducing the threat of a nuclear war. I will sign no
               agreement which does not enhance our national security.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">SALT II does not rely on trust; it will be verifiable. We have very
            sophisticated, proven means, including our satellites, to determine for
            ourselves whether or not the Soviet Union is meeting its treaty
            obligations. I will sign no agreement which cannot be verified.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">&gt;The American nuclear deterrent will remain strong after SALT II. For
            example, just one of our relatively invulnerable Poseidon
            submarines--comprising less than 2 percent of our total nuclear force of
            submarines, aircraft, and land-based missiles--carries enough warheads
            to destroy every large- and medium-sized city in the Soviet Union. Our
            deterrent is overwhelming, and I will sign no agreement unless our
            deterrent force will remain overwhelming.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">A SALT agreement, of course, cannot substitute for wise diplomacy or a
               strong defense, nor will it end the danger of nuclear war.</span> But it will
            certainly reduce that danger. It will strengthen our efforts to ban
            nuclear tests and to stop the spread of atomic weapons to other nations.
            And it can begin the process of negotiating new agreements which will
            further limit nuclear arms.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The path of arms control, backed by a strong defense, the path our
            Nation and every President has walked for 30 years, can lead to a world
            of law and of international negotiation and consultation in which all
            peoples might live in peace. In this year 1979, nothing is more
            important than that the Congress and the people of the United States
            resolve to continue with me on that path of nuclear arms control and
            world peace.</span> This is paramount.</p>
      <p>I've outlined some of the changes that have transformed the world and
         which are continuing as we meet here tonight. But we in America need not
         fear change. The values on which our Nation was founded: individual
         liberty, self-determination, the potential for human fulfillment in
         freedom, all of these endure. We find these democratic principles
         praised, even in books smuggled out of totalitarian nations and on
         wallposters in lands which we thought were closed to our influence. Our
         country has regained its special place of leadership in the worldwide
         struggle for human rights. And that is a commitment that we must keep at
         home, as well as abroad.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The civil rights revolution freed all Americans, black and white, but
            its full promise still remains unrealized. I will continue to work with
            all my strength for equal opportunity for all Americans--and for
            affirmative action for those who carry the extra burden of past denial
            of equal opportunity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We remain committed to improving our labor laws to better protect the
            rights of American workers. And our Nation must make it clear that the
            legal rights of women as citizens are guaranteed under the laws of our
            land by ratifying the equal rights amendment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">As long as I'm President, at home and around the world America's
            examples and America's influence will be marshaled to advance the cause
            of human rights.</span></p>
      <p>To establish those values, two centuries ago a bold generation of
         Americans risked their property, their position, and life itself. We are
         their heirs, and they are sending us a message across the centuries. The
         words they made so vivid are now growing faintly indistinct, because
         they are not heard often enough. They are words like "justice,"
         "equality," "unity," "truth," "sacrifice," "liberty," "faith," and
         "love."</p>
      <p>These words remind us that the duty of our generation of Americans is to
         renew our Nation's faith, not focused just against foreign threats but
         against the threats of selfishness, cynicism, and apathy.</p>
      <p>The new foundation I've discussed tonight can help us build a nation and
         a world where every child is nurtured and can look to the future with
         hope, where the resources now wasted on war can be turned towards
         meeting human needs, where all people have enough to eat, a decent home,
         and protection against disease.</p>
      <p>It can help us build a nation and a world where all people are free to
         seek the truth and to add to human understanding, so that all of us may
         live our lives in peace.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I ask you, the Members of the Congress, to join me in building
         that new foundation, a better foundation, for our beloved country and
         our world.</p>
      <p>Thank you very much.

      <h3>January 21, 1980</h3>
      <p>This last few months has not been an easy time for any of us. As we meet
         tonight, it has never been more clear that the state of our Union
         depends on the state of the world. And tonight, as throughout our own
         generation, freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our
         Union.</p>
      <p>The 1980's have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time
         of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests
         our wisdom and our skills.</p>
      <p><span class="war">At this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent
            victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet
            troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply
            religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts--one of international
            terrorism and one of military aggression--present a serious challenge to
            the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world.</span>
         Together, we will meet these threats to peace.</p>
      <p><span class="war">I'm determined that the United States will remain the strongest of all
            nations, <span class="civil-rights">but our power will never be used to initiate a threat to the
               security of any nation or to the rights of any human being.</span> We seek to
            be and to remain secure--a nation at peace in a stable world. But to be
            secure we must face the world as it is.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady
            growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own
            borders;</span> <span class="infra">the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil
            supplies from the Middle East;</span> <span class="civil-rights"><span class="economy">and the press of social and religious and
               economic and political change in the many nations of the developing
               world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.</span></span></p>
      <p>Each of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with
         the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We
         will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is
         in us. And we will not fail.</p>
      <p>In response to the abhorrent act in Iran, our Nation has never been
         aroused and unified so greatly in peacetime. Our position is clear. The
         United States will not yield to blackmail.</p>
      <p>We continue to pursue these specific goals: first, to protect the
         present and long-range interests of the United States; secondly, to
         preserve the lives of the American hostages and to secure, as quickly as
         possible, their safe release, if possible, to avoid bloodshed which
         might further endanger the lives of our fellow citizens; to enlist the
         help of other nations in condemning this act of violence, which is
         shocking and violates the moral and the legal standards of a civilized
         world; and also to convince and to persuade the Iranian leaders that the
         real danger to their nation lies in the north, in the Soviet Union and
         from the Soviet troops now in Afghanistan, and that the unwarranted
         Iranian quarrel with the United States hampers their response to this
         far greater danger to them.</p>
      <p><span class="war">If the American hostages are harmed, a severe price will be paid. We
            will never rest until every one of the American hostages are released.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But now we face a broader and more fundamental challenge in this region
            because of the recent military action of the Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">Now, as during the last 3 1/2 decades, the relationship between our
               country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most
               critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or
               be engulfed in global conflict.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Since the end of the Second World War, America has led other nations in
            meeting the challenge of mounting Soviet power. This has not been a
            simple or a static relationship. Between us there has been cooperation,
            there has been competition, and at times there has been confrontation.</span></p>
      <p>In the 1940's we took the lead in creating the Atlantic Alliance in
         response to the Soviet Union's suppression and then consolidation of its
         East European empire and the resulting threat of the Warsaw Pact to
         Western Europe.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In the 1950's we helped to contain further Soviet challenges in Korea
            and in the Middle East, and we rearmed to assure the continuation of
            that containment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">In the 1960's we met the Soviet challenges in Berlin, and we faced the
               Cuban missile crisis. And we sought to engage the Soviet Union in the
               important task of moving beyond the cold war and away from
               confrontation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">And in the 1970's three American Presidents negotiated with the Soviet
               leaders in attempts to halt the growth of the nuclear arms race. We
               sought to establish rules of behavior that would reduce the risks of
               conflict, and we searched for areas of cooperation that could make our
               relations reciprocal and productive, not only for the sake of our two
               nations but for the security and peace of the entire world.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">In all these actions, we have maintained two commitments: to be ready to
               meet any challenge by Soviet military power, and to develop ways to
               resolve disputes and to keep the peace.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Preventing nuclear war is the foremost responsibility of the two
            superpowers.</span> <span class="economy">That's why we've negotiated the strategic arms limitation
            treaties--SALT I and SALT II. Especially now, in a time of great
            tension, observing the mutual constraints imposed by the terms of these
            treaties will be in the best interest of both countries and will help to
            preserve world peace.</span> I will consult very closely with the Congress on
         this matter as we strive to control nuclear weapons. That effort to
         control nuclear weapons will not be abandoned.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the
            use of our great military force. The integrity and the independence of
            weaker nations must not be threatened.</span> They must know that in our
         presence they are secure.</p>
      <p>But now the Soviet Union has taken a radical and an aggressive new step.
         <span class="war">It's using its great military power against a relatively defenseless
            nation. The implications of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan could
            pose the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The vast majority of nations on Earth have condemned this latest Soviet
            attempt to extend its colonial domination of others and have demanded
            the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops.</span> The Moslem world is
         especially and justifiably outraged by this aggression against an
         Islamic people. No action of a world power has ever been so quickly and
         so overwhelmingly condemned. But verbal condemnation is not enough. The
         Soviet Union must pay a concrete price for their aggression.</p>
      <p>While this invasion continues, we and the other nations of the world
         cannot conduct business as usual with the Soviet Union. <span class="war"><span class="economy">That's why the
               United States has imposed stiff economic penalties on the Soviet Union.
               I will not issue any permits for Soviet ships to fish in the coastal
               waters of the United States.</span> I've cut Soviet access to high-technology
            equipment and to agricultural products. I've limited other commerce with
            the Soviet Union, and I've asked our allies and friends to join with us
            in restraining their own trade with the Soviets and not to replace our
            own embargoed items.</span> And I have notified the Olympic Committee that with
         Soviet invading forces in Afghanistan, neither the American people nor I
         will support sending an Olympic team to Moscow.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The Soviet Union is going to have to answer some basic questions: Will
            it help promote a more stable international environment in which its own
            legitimate, peaceful concerns can be pursued? Or will it continue to
            expand its military power far beyond its genuine security needs, and use
            that power for colonial conquest?</span> <span class="economy">The Soviet Union must realize that its
            decision to use military force in Afghanistan will be costly to every
            political and economic relationship it values.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The region which is now threatened by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of
            great strategic importance: It contains more than two-thirds of the
            world's exportable oil. The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has
            brought Soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean
            and close to the Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which most of the
            world's oil must flow.</span> The Soviet Union is now attempting to consolidate
         a strategic position, therefore, that poses a grave threat to the free
         movement of Middle East oil.</p>
      <p>This situation demands careful thought, steady nerves, and resolute
         action, not only for this year but for many years to come. It demands
         collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian
         Gulf and in Southwest Asia. It demands the participation of all those
         who rely on oil from the Middle East and who are concerned with global
         peace and stability. And it demands consultation and close cooperation
         with countries in the area which might be threatened.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Meeting this challenge will take national will, diplomatic and political
               wisdom, economic sacrifice, and, of course, military capability.</span></span> We must
         call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial
         region.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to
            gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault
            on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an
            assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military
            force.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">During the past 3 years, you have joined with me to improve our own
            security and the prospects for peace, not only in the vital
            oil-producing area of the Persian Gulf region but around the world.
            We've increased annually our real commitment for defense, and we will
            sustain this increase of effort throughout the Five Year Defense
            Program. It's imperative that Congress approve this strong defense
            budget for 1981, encompassing a 5-percent real growth in authorizations,
            without any reduction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are also improving our capability to deploy U.S. military forces
            rapidly to distant areas. We've helped to strengthen NATO and our other
            alliances, and recently we and other NATO members have decided to
            develop and to deploy modernized, intermediate-range nuclear forces to
            meet an unwarranted and increased threat from the nuclear weapons of the
            Soviet Union.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">We are working with our allies to prevent conflict in the Middle East.
               The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel is a notable achievement which
               represents a strategic asset for America and which also enhances
               prospects for regional and world peace. We are now engaged in further
               negotiations to provide full autonomy for the people of the West Bank
               and Gaza, to resolve the Palestinian issue in all its aspects, and to
               preserve the peace and security of Israel. Let no one doubt our
               commitment to the security of Israel.</span></span> In a few days we will observe an
         historic event when Israel makes another major withdrawal from the Sinai
         and when Ambassadors will be exchanged between Israel and Egypt.</p>
      <p>We've also expanded our own sphere of friendship. <span class="civil-rights"><span class="diplomacy">Our deep commitment to
               human rights and to meeting human needs has improved our relationship
               with much of the Third World.</span> Our decision to normalize relations with
            the People's Republic of China will help to preserve peace and stability
            in Asia and in the Western Pacific.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We've increased and strengthened our naval presence in the Indian Ocean,
            and we are now making arrangements for key naval and air facilities to
            be used by our forces in the region of northeast Africa and the Persian
            Gulf.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We've reconfirmed our 1959 agreement to help Pakistan preserve its
            independence and its integrity. The United States will take action
            consistent with our own laws to assist Pakistan in resisting any outside
            aggression. And I'm asking the Congress specifically to reaffirm this
            agreement.</span> <span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">I'm also working, along with the leaders of other nations, to
               provide additional military and economic aid for Pakistan. That request
               will come to you in just a few days.</span></span></p>
      <p>Finally, we are prepared to work with other countries in the region to
         share a cooperative security framework that respects differing values
         and political beliefs, yet which enhances the independence, security,
         and prosperity of all.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">All these efforts combined emphasize our dedication to defend and
            preserve the vital interests of the region and of the nation which we
            represent and those of our allies--in Europe and the Pacific, and also
            in the parts of the world which have such great strategic importance to
            us, stretching especially through the Middle East and Southwest Asia.</span>
         With your help, I will pursue these efforts with vigor and with
         determination. <span class="war">You and I will act as necessary to protect and to
            preserve our Nation's security.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The men and women of America's Armed Forces are on duty tonight in many
            parts of the world. I'm proud of the job they are doing, and I know you
            share that pride. I believe that our volunteer forces are adequate for
            current defense needs, and I hope that it will not become necessary to
            impose a draft. However, we must be prepared for that possibility. For
            this reason, I have determined that the Selective Service System must
            now be revitalized.</span> I will send legislation and budget proposals to the
         Congress next month so that we can begin registration and then meet
         future mobilization needs rapidly if they arise.</p>
      <p>We also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the
         legal authority and accountability of our intelligence agencies. We will
         guarantee that abuses do not recur, but we must tighten our controls on
         sensitive intelligence information, and we need to remove unwarranted
         restraints on America's ability to collect intelligence.</p>
      <p>The decade ahead will be a time of rapid change, as nations everywhere
         seek to deal with new problems and age-old tensions. But America need
         have no fear. We can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to
         our values and actively engaged in promoting world peace. We will
         continue to work as we have for peace in the Middle East and southern
         Africa. <span class="diplomacy">We will continue to build our ties with developing nations,
            respecting and helping to strengthen their national independence which
            they have struggled so hard to achieve.</span> <span class="civil-rights">And we will continue to support
            the growth of democracy and the protection of human rights.</span></p>
      <p>In repressive regimes, popular frustrations often have no outlet except
         through violence. But when peoples and their governments can approach
         their problems together through open, democratic methods, the basis for
         stability and peace is far more solid and far more enduring. <span class="civil-rights">That is why
            our support for human rights in other countries is in our own national
            interest as well as part of our own national character.</span></p>
      <p>Peace--a peace that preserves freedom--remains America's first goal. In
         the coming years, as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace.
         But to be strong abroad we must be strong at home. And in order to be
         strong, we must continue to face up to the difficult issues that
         confront us as a nation today.</p>
      <p>The crises in Iran and Afghanistan have dramatized a very important
         lesson: <span class="war"><span class="infra">Our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present
               danger to our Nation's security. The need has never been more urgent. At
               long last, we must have a clear, comprehensive energy policy for the
               United States.</span></span></p>
      <p>As you well know, I have been working with the Congress in a
         concentrated and persistent way over the past 3 years to meet this need.
         We have made progress together. <span class="infra">But Congress must act promptly now to
            complete final action on this vital energy legislation. Our Nation will
            then have a major conservation effort, important initiatives to develop
            solar power, realistic pricing based on the true value of oil, strong
            incentives for the production of coal and other fossil fuels in the
            United States, and our Nation's most massive peacetime investment in the
            development of synthetic fuels.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">The American people are making progress in energy conservation. Last
            year we reduced overall petroleum consumption by 8 percent and gasoline
            consumption by 5 percent below what it was the year before.</span> Now we must
         do more.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">After consultation with the Governors, we will set gasoline conservation
            goals for each of the 50 States, and I will make them mandatory if these
            goals are not met.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I've established an import ceiling for 1980 of 8.2 million barrels a
            day--well below the level of foreign oil purchases in 1977. I expect our
            imports to be much lower than this, but the ceiling will be enforced by
            an oil import fee if necessary. I'm prepared to lower these imports
            still further if the other oil-consuming countries will join us in a
            fair and mutual reduction. If we have a serious shortage, I will not
            hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline rationing immediately.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="infra">The single biggest factor in the inflation rate last year, the increase
               in the inflation rate last year, was from one cause: the skyrocketing
               prices of OPEC oil. We must take whatever actions are necessary to
               reduce our dependence on foreign oil--and at the same time reduce
               inflation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">As individuals and as families, few of us can produce energy by
            ourselves. But all of us can conserve energy--every one of us, every day
            of our lives. Tonight I call on you--in fact, all the people of
            America--to help our Nation. Conserve energy. Eliminate waste. Make 1980
            indeed a year of energy conservation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Of course, we must take other actions to strengthen our Nation's
            economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the
            Federal budget.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Second, as we continue to work with business to hold down prices, we'll
            build also on the historic national accord with organized labor to
            restrain pay increases in a fair fight against inflation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Third, we will continue our successful efforts to cut paperwork and to
            dismantle unnecessary Government regulation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Fourth, we will continue our progress in providing jobs for America,
            concentrating on a major new program to provide training and work for
            our young people, especially minority youth. It has been said that "a
            mind is a terrible thing to waste." We will give our young people new
            hope for jobs and a better life in the 1980's.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And fifth, we must use the decade of the 1980's to attack the basic
            structural weaknesses and problems in our economy through measures to
            increase productivity, savings, and investment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">With these energy and economic policies, we will make America even
            stronger at home in this decade--just as our foreign and defense
            policies will make us stronger and safer throughout the world. We will
            never abandon our struggle for a just and a decent society here at home.
            That's the heart of America--and it's the source of our ability to
            inspire other people to defend their own rights abroad.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our material resources, great as they are, are limited. Our problems are
            too complex for simple slogans or for quick solutions.</span> We cannot solve
         them without effort and sacrifice. Walter Lippmann once reminded us,
         "You took the good things for granted. Now you must earn them again. For
         every right that you cherish, you have a duty which you must fulfill.
         For every good which you wish to preserve, you will have to sacrifice
         your comfort and your ease. There is nothing for nothing any longer."</p>
      <p>Our challenges are formidable. But there's a new spirit of unity and
         resolve in our country. We move into the 1980's with confidence and hope
         and a bright vision of the America we want: an America strong and free,
         an America at peace, an America with equal rights for all citizens--and
         for women, guaranteed in the United States Constitution--an America with
         jobs and good health and good education for every citizen, an America
         with a clean and bountiful life in our cities and on our farms, an
         America that helps to feed the world, an America secure in filling its
         own energy needs, an America of justice, tolerance, and compassion. For
         this vision to come true, we must sacrifice, but this national
         commitment will be an exciting enterprise that will unify our people.</p>
      <p>Together as one people, let us work to build our strength at home, and
         together as one indivisible union, let us seek peace and security
         throughout the world.</p>
      <p>Together let us make of this time of challenge and danger a decade of
         national resolve and of brave achievement.</p>
      <p>Thank you very much.

      <h3>January 16, 1981</h3>
      <p>To the Congress of the United States:</p>
      <p>The State of the Union is sound. <span class="economy">Our economy is recovering from a
            recession.</span> <span class="infra">A national energy plan is in place and our dependence on
            foreign oil is decreasing.</span> <span class="war">We have been at peace for four uninterrupted
            years.</span></p>
      <p>But, our Nation has serious problems. <span class="economy"><span class="poverty">Inflation and unemployment are
               unacceptably high.</span></span> <span class="infra">The world oil market is increasingly tight.</span> There are
         trouble spots throughout the world, <span class="diplomacy">and 52 American hostages are being
            held in Iran against international law and against every precept of
            human affairs.</span></p>
      <p>However, <span class="diplomacy">I firmly believe that, as a result of the progress made in so
            many domestic and international areas over the past four years</span>, our
         Nation is stronger, wealthier, more compassionate and freer than it was
         four years ago. I am proud of that fact. And I believe the Congress
         should be proud as well, for so much of what has been accomplished over
         the past four years has been due to the hard work, insights and
         cooperation of Congress. I applaud the Congress for its efforts and its
         achievements.</p>
      <p>In this State of the Union Message I want to recount the achievements
         and progress of the last four years and to offer recommendations to the
         Congress for this year. While my term as President will end before the
         97th Congress begins its work in earnest, I hope that my recommendations
         will serve as a guide for the direction this country should take so we
         build on the record of the past four years.</p>
      <p>RECORD OF PROGRESS</p>
      <p>When I took office, our Nation faced a number of serious domestic and
         international problems:</p>
      <p><span class="infra">--no national energy policy existed, and our dependence on foreign oil
            was rapidly increasing;</span></p>
      <p>--public trust in the integrity and openness of the government was low;</p>
      <p>--the Federal government was operating inefficiently in administering
         essential programs and policies;</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--major social problems were being ignored or poorly addressed by the
            Federal government;</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">--our defense posture was declining as a result of a defense budget
            which was continuously shrinking in real terms;</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the strength of the NATO Alliance needed to be bolstered;</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">--tensions between Israel and Egypt threatened another Middle East war;
            and</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--America's resolve to oppose human rights violations was under serious
            question.</span></p>
      <p>Over the past 48 months, clear progress has been made in solving the
         challenges we found in January of 1977:</p>
      <p><span class="infra">--almost all of our comprehensive energy program have been enacted, and
            the Department of Energy has been established to administer the program;
            confidence in the government's integrity has been restored, and respect
            for the government's openness and fairness has been renewed;</span></p>
      <p>--the government has been made more effective and efficient: the Civil
         Service system was completely reformed for the first time this century;</p>
      <p>--14 reorganization initiatives have been proposed to the Congress,
         approved, and implemented;</p>
      <p>--two new Cabinet departments have been created to consolidate and
         streamline the government's handling of energy and education problems;</p>
      <p>--inspectors general have been placed in each Cabinet department to
         combat fraud, waste and other abuses;</p>
      <p>--the regulatory process has been reformed through creation of the
         Regulatory Council, implementation of Executive Order 12044 and its
         requirement for cost-impact analyses, elimination of unnecessary
         regulation, and passage of the Regulatory Flexibility Act;</p>
      <p>--procedures have been established to assure citizen participation in
         government;</p>
      <p>--and the airline, trucking, rail and communications industries are
         being deregulated;</p>
      <p>--critical social problems, many long ignored by the Federal government,
         have been addressed directly;</p>
      <p>--an urban policy was developed and implemented to reverse the decline
         in our urban areas;</p>
      <p>--the Social Security System was refinanced to put it on a sound
         financial basis;</p>
      <p>--the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act was enacted;</p>
      <p>--Federal assistance for education was expanded by more than 75 percent;</p>
      <p><span class="economy">--the minimum wage was increased to levels needed to ease the effects of
            inflation;</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--affirmative action has been pursued aggressively; more blacks,
            Hispanics and women have been appointed to senior government positions
            and to judgeships than at any other time in our history;</span></p>
      <p>--the ERA ratification deadline was extended to aid the ratification
         effort;</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--and minority business procurement by the Federal government has more
            than doubled;</span></p>
      <p>--the Nation's first sectoral policies were put in place, for the auto
         and steel industries, with my Administration demonstrating the value of
         cooperation between the government, business and labor;</p>
      <p><span class="war">--reversing previous trends, real defense spending has increased every
            year since 1977;</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">--the real increase in FY 1980 defense spending is well above 3 percent
            and I expect FY 1981 defense spending to be even higher;</span></p>
      <p>--looking ahead, the defense program I am proposing is premised on a
         real increase in defense spending over the next five years of 20 percent
         or more;</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the NATO Alliance has proven its unity in responding to the situations
            in Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia and in agreeing on the issues to be
            addressed in the review of the Helsinki Final Act currently underway in
            Madrid;</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the peace process in the Middle East established at Camp David and by
            the Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is being buttressed on two
            fronts: steady progress in the normalization of Egyptian-Israeli
            relations in many fields, and the commitment of both Egypt and Israel,
            with United States' assistance, to see through to successful conclusion
            the autonomy negotiations for the West Bank and Gaza;</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the Panama Canal Treaties have been put into effect, which has helped
            to improve relations with Latin America;</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--we have continued this Nation's strong commitment to the pursuit of
            human rights throughout the world, evenhandedly and objectively;</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--our commitment to a worldwide human rights policy has remained firm;</span></p>
      <p>--and many other countries have given high priority to it;</p>
      <p><span class="war">--our resolve to oppose aggression, such as the illegal invasion of the
            Soviet Union into Afghanistan, has been supported by tough action.</span></p>
      <p>I. ENSURING ECONOMIC STRENGTH ECONOMY</p>
      <p><span class="economy">During the last decade our Nation has withstood a series of economic
            shocks unprecedented in peacetime. <span class="infra">The most dramatic of these has been
               the explosive increases of OPEC oil prices. But we have also faced world
               commodity shortages, natural disasters, agricultural shortages and major
               challenges to world peace and security</span></span>. Our ability to deal with these
         shocks has been impaired because of a decrease in the growth of
         productivity and the persistence of underlying inflationary forces built
         up over the past 15 years.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Nevertheless, the economy has proved to be remarkably resilient. Real
            output has grown at an average rate of 3 percent per year since I took
            office, and employment has grown by 10 percent. We have added about 8
            million productive private sector jobs to the economy. However,
            unacceptably high inflation--the most difficult economic problem I have
            faced--persists.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This inflation--which threatens the growth, productivity, and stability
            of our economy--requires that we restrain the growth of the budget to
            the maximum extent consistent with national security and human
            compassion. I have done so in my earlier budgets, and in my FY '82
            budget. However, while restraint is essential to any appropriate
            economic policy, high inflation cannot be attributed solely to
            government spending. The growth in budget outlays has been more the
            result of economic factors than the cause of them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We are now in the early stages of economic recovery following a short
            recession. Typically, a post-recessionary period has been marked by
            vigorous economic growth aided by anti-recessionary policy measures such
            as large tax cuts or big, stimulation spending programs. I have declined
            to recommend such actions to stimulate economic activity, because the
            persistent inflationary pressures that beset our economy today dictate a
            restrained fiscal policy.</span></p>
      <p>Accordingly, I am asking the Congress to postpone until January 1, 1982,
         the personal tax reductions I had earlier proposed to take effect on
         January 1 of this year.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">However, my 1982 budget proposes significant tax changes to increase the
            sources of financing for business investment. While emphasizing the need
            for continued fiscal restraint, this budget takes the first major step
            in a long-term tax reduction program designed to increase capital
            formation. The failure of our Nation's capital stock to grow at a rate
            that keeps pace with its labor force has clearly been one cause of our
            productivity slowdown. Higher investment rates are also critically
            needed to meet our Nation's energy needs, and to replace
            energy-inefficient plants and equipment with new energy-saving physical
            plants.</span> The level of investment that is called for will not occur in the
         absence of policies to encourage it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Therefore, my budget proposes a major liberalization of tax allowances
            for depreciation, as well as simplified depreciation accounting,
            increasing the allowable rates by about 40 percent. I am also proposing
            improvements in the investment tax credit, making it refundable, to meet
            the investment needs of firms with no current earnings.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">These two proposals, along with carefully-phased tax reductions for
            individuals, will improve both economic efficiency and tax equity. I
            urge the Congress to enact legislation along the lines and timetable I
            have proposed.</span></p>
      <p>THE 1982 BUDGET</p>
      <p>The FY 1982 budget I have sent to the Congress continues our four-year
         policy of prudence and restraint. While the budget deficits during my
         term are higher than I would have liked, their size is determined for
         the most part by economic conditions. And in spite of these conditions,
         the relative size of the deficit continues to decline. In 1976, before I
         took office, the budget deficit equalled 4 percent of gross national
         product. It had been cut to 2.3 percent in the 1980 fiscal year just
         ended. My 1982 budget contains a deficit estimated to be less than 1
         percent of our gross national product.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The rate of growth in Federal spending has been held to a minimum.
            Nevertheless, outlays are still rising more rapidly than many had
            anticipated, the result of many powerful forces in our society:</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We face a threat to our security, as events in Afghanistan, the Middle
            East, and Eastern Europe make clear.</span> <span class="economy">We have a steadily aging population
            and, as a result, the biggest single increase in the Federal budget is
            the rising cost of retirement programs, particularly social security.</span> <span class="civil-rights">We
            face other important domestic needs: to continue responsibility for the
            disadvantaged;</span> to provide the capital needed by our cities and our
         transportation systems; to protect our environment; to revitalize
         American industry; and to increase the export of American goods and
         services so essential to the creation of jobs and a trade surplus.</p>
      <p>Yet the Federal Government itself may not always be the proper source of
         such assistance. For example, it must not usurp functions if they can be
         more appropriately decided upon, managed, and financed by the private
         sector or by State and local governments. My Administration has always
         sought to consider the proper focus of responsibility for the most
         efficient resolution of problems.</p>
      <p>We have also recognized the need to simplify the system of grants to
         State and local governments. <span class="infra">I have again proposed several grant
            consolidations in the 1982 budget, including a new proposal that would
            consolidate several highway programs.</span></p>
      <p>The pressures for growth in Federal use of national resources are great.
         My Administration has initiated many new approaches to cope with these
         pressures. <span class="economy">We started a multi-year budget system, and we began a system
            for controlling Federal credit programs. Yet in spite of increasing
            needs to limit spending growth, we have consistently adhered to these
            strong budget principles:</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our Nation's armed forces must always stand sufficiently strong to deter
            aggression and to assure our security.</span> <span class="infra">An effective national energy plan
            is essential to increase domestic production of oil and gas, to
            encourage conservation of our scarce energy resources, to stimulate
            conversion to more abundant fuels, and to reduce our trade deficit.</span> The
         essential human needs for our citizens must be given the highest
         priority. The Federal Government must lead the way in investment in the
         Nation's technological future. The Federal Government has an obligation
         to nurture and protect our environment--the common resource, birthright,
         and sustenance of the American people.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">My 1982 budget continues to support these principles. It also proposes
            responsible tax reductions to encourage a more productive economy, and
            adequate funding of our highest priority programs within an overall
            policy of constraint.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Fiscal restraint must be continued in the years ahead. Budgets must be
            tight enough to convince those who set wages and prices that the Federal
            Government is serious about fighting inflation but not so tight as to
            choke off all growth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Careful budget policy should be supplemented by other measures designed
            to reduce inflation at lower cost in lost output and employment. These
            other steps include measures to increase investment--such as the tax
            proposals included in my 1982 budget--and measures to increase
            competition and productivity in our economy. Voluntary incomes policies
            can also directly influence wages and prices in the direction of
            moderation and thereby bring inflation down faster and at lower cost to
            the economy. Through a tax-based incomes policy (TIP) we could provide
            tax incentives for firms and workers to moderate their wage and price
            increases. In the coming years, control of Federal expenditures can make
            possible periodic tax reductions. The Congress should therefore begin
            now to evaluate the potentialities of a TIP program so that when the
            next round of tax reductions is appropriate a TIP program will be
            seriously considered.</span></p>
      <p>EMPLOYMENT</p>
      <p>During the last four years we have given top priority to meeting the
         needs of workers and providing additional job opportunities to those who
         seek work. Since the end of 1976:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Almost 9 million new jobs have been added to the nation's economy total
            employment has reached 97 million. <span class="civil-rights">More jobs than ever before are held
               by women, minorities and young people.</span> <span class="civil-rights">Employment over the past four
               years has increased by: 17% for adult women 11% for blacks, and 30% for
               Hispanics employment of black teenagers increased by more than 5%,
               reversing the decline that occurred in the previous eight years.</span></span></p>
      <p>Major initiatives launched by this Administration helped bring about
         these accomplishments and have provided a solid foundation for
         employment and training policy in the 1980's. In 1977, as part of the
         comprehensive economic stimulus program:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">425,000 public service jobs were created A $1 billion youth employment
            initiative funded 200,000 jobs the doubling of the Job Corps to 44,000
            slots began and 1 million summer youth jobs were approved--a 25 percent
            increase.</span></p>
      <p>In 1978:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act became law the $400 million
            Private Sector Initiatives Program was begun a targeted jobs tax credit
            for disadvantaged youth and others with special employment barriers was
            enacted the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act was reauthorized
            for four years.</span></p>
      <p>In 1979:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A $6 billion welfare reform proposal was introduced with funding for
            400,000 public service jobs welfare reform demonstration projects were
            launched in communities around the country the Vice President initiated
            a nationwide review of youth unemployment in this country.</span></p>
      <p>In 1980:</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights"><span class="poverty">The findings of the Vice President's Task Force revealed the major
               education and employment deficits that exist for poor and minority
               youngsters.</span></span> As a result a $2 billion youth education and jobs initiative
         was introduced to provide unemployed youth with the basic education and
         work experience they need to compete in the labor market of the 1980's.
         As part of the economic revitalization program several steps were
         proposed to aid workers in high unemployment communities:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">An additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for the long term
            unemployed. $600 million to train the disadvantaged and unemployed for
            new private sector jobs. Positive adjustment demonstrations to aid
            workers in declining industries.</span> The important Title VII Private Sector
         Initiatives Program was reauthorized for an additional two years.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">In addition to making significant progress in helping the disadvantaged
            and unemployed, important gains were realized for all workers:</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">An historic national accord with organized labor made it possible for
            the views of working men and women to be heard as the nation's economic
            and domestic policies were formulated; the Mine Safety and Health Act
            brought about improved working conditions for the nation's 500,000
            miners.</span> substantial reforms of Occupational Safety and Health
         Administration were accomplished to help reduce unnecessary burdens on
         business and to focus on major health and safety problems; the minimum
         wage was increased over a four year period from $2.30 to $3.35 an hour;
         the Black Lung Benefit Reform Act was signed into law; attempts to
         weaken Davis-Bacon Act were defeated.</p>
      <p>While substantial gains have been made in the last four years, continued
         efforts are required to ensure that this progress is continued:</p>
      <p>Government must continue to make labor a full partner in the policy
         decisions that affect the interests of working men and women; a broad,
         bipartisan effort to combat youth unemployment must be sustained
         compassionate reform of the nation's welfare system should be continued
         with employment opportunities provided for those able to work; workers
         in declining industries should be provided new skills and help in
         finding employment.</p>
      <p>TRADE</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Over the past year, the U.S. trade picture improved as a result of solid
            export gains in both manufactured and agricultural products.
            Agricultural exports reached a new record of over $40 billion, while
            manufactured exports have grown by 24 percent to a record $144 billion.
            In these areas the United States recorded significant surpluses of $24
            billion and $19 billion respectively. While our oil imports remained a
            major drain on our foreign exchange earnings, that drain was somewhat
            moderated by a 19 percent decline in the volume of oil imports.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">U.S. trade negotiators made significant progress over the past year in
            assuring effective implementation of the agreements negotiated during
            the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Agreements reached
            with the Japanese government, for example, will assure that the United
            States will be able to expand its exports to the Japanese market in such
            key areas as telecommunications equipment, tobacco, and lumber.</span> Efforts
         by U.S. trade negotiators also helped to persuade a number of key
         developing countries to accept many of the non-tariff codes negotiated
         during the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. This will assure that these
         countries will increasingly assume obligations under the international
         trading system.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">A difficult world economic environment posed a challenge for the
               management of trade relations. U.S. trade negotiators were called upon
               to manage serious sectoral problems in such areas as steel, and helped
               to assure that U.S. chemical exports will have continued access to the
               European market.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Close consultations with the private sector in the United States have
            enabled U.S. trade negotiators to pinpoint obstacles to U.S. trade in
            services, and to build a basis for future negotiations. Services have
            been an increasingly important source of export earnings for the United
            States, and the United States must assure continued and increased access
            to foreign markets.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The trade position of the United States has improved. But vigorous
            efforts are needed in a number of areas to assure continued market
            access for U.S. exports, particularly agricultural and high technology
            products, in which the United States continues to have a strong
            competitive edge. Continued efforts are also needed to remove many
            domestic disincentives, which now hamper U.S. export growth.</span> And we must
         ensure that countries do not manipulate investment, or impose investment
         performance requirements which distort trade and cost us jobs in this
         country.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In short, we must continue to seek free--but fair--trade. That is the
            policy my Administration has pursued from the beginning, even in areas
            where foreign competition has clearly affected our domestic industry.</span> <span class="infra">In
            the steel industry, for instance, we have put Trigger Price Mechanism
            into place to help prevent the dumping of steel. That action has
            strengthened the domestic steel industry. In the automobile industry, we
            have worked-- without resort to import quotas--to strengthen the
            industry's ability to modernize and compete effectively.</span></p>
      <p>SMALL BUSINESS</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I have often said that there is nothing small about small business in
            America. These firms account for nearly one-half our gross national
            product; over half of new technology; and much more than half of the
            jobs created by industry.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Because this sector of the economy is the very lifeblood of our National
            economy, we have done much together to improve the competitive climate
            for smaller firms. These concerted efforts have been an integral part of
            my program to revitalize the economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">They include my campaign to shrink substantially the cash and time
            consuming red tape burden imposed on business. They include my
            personally-directed policy of ambitiously increasing the Federal
            contracting dollars going to small firms, especially those owned by
            women and minorities. And they include my proposals to reinvigorate
            existing small businesses and assist the creation of new ones through
            tax reform; financing assistance; market expansion; and support of
            product innovation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Many of my initiatives to facilitate the creation and growth of small
            businesses were made in response to the White House Conference on Small
            Business, which I convened.</span> My Administration began the implementation
         of most of the ideas produced last year by that citizen's advisory body;
         others need to be addressed. I have proposed the reconvening of the
         Conference next year to review progress; reassess priorities; and set
         new goals. In the interim I hope that the incoming Administration and
         the new Congress will work with the committee I have established to keep
         these business development ideas alive and help implement Conference
         recommendations.</p>
      <p>MINORITY BUSINESS</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="civil-rights">One of the most successful developments of my Administration has been
               the growth and strengthening of minority business. This is the first
               Administration to put the issue on the policy agenda as a matter of
               major importance. To implement the results of our early efforts in this
               field I submitted legislation to Congress designed to further the
               development of minority business.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="civil-rights">We have reorganized the Office of Minority Business into the Minority
               Business Development Administration in the Department of Commerce. MBDA
               has already proven to be a major factor in assisting minority businesses
               to achieve equitable competitive positions in the marketplace.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The Federal government's procurement from minority-owned firms has
            nearly tripled since I took office. Federal deposits in minority-owned
            banks have more than doubled and minority ownership of radio and
            television stations has nearly doubled.</span> The SBA administered 8(a) Pilot
         Program for procurement with the Army proved to be successful and I
         recently expanded the number of agencies involved to include NASA and
         the Departments of Energy and Transportation.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I firmly believe the critical path to full freedom and equality for
            America's minorities rests with the ability of minority communities to
            participate competitively in the free enterprise system. I believe the
            government has a fundamental responsibility to assist in the development
            of minority business and I hope the progress made in the last four years
            will continue.</span></p>
      <p>II. CREATING ENERGY SECURITY</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Since I took office, my highest legislative priorities have involved the
            reorientation and redirection of U.S. energy activities and for the
            first time, to establish a coordinated national energy policy. The
            struggle to achieve that policy has been long and difficult, but the
            accomplishments of the past four years make clear that our country is
            finally serious about the problems caused by our overdependence on
            foreign oil. Our progress should not be lost. We must rely on and
            encourage multiple forms of energy production--coal, crude oil, natural
            gas, solar, nuclear, synthetics--and energy conservation. The framework
            put in place over the last four years will enable us to do this.</span></p>
      <p>NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY</p>
      <p>As a result of actions my Administration and the Congress have taken
         over the past four years, our country finally has a national energy
         policy:</p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="economy">"&gt;Under my program of phased decontrol, domestic crude oil price controls
               will end September 30, 1981. As a result exploratory drilling activities
               have reached an all-time high; Prices for new natural gas are being
               decontrolled under the Natural Gas Policy Act--and natural gas
               production is now at an all time high; the supply shortages of several
               years ago have been eliminated; The windfall profits tax on crude oil
               has been enacted providing $227 billion over ten years for assistance to
               low-income households, increased mass transit funding, and a massive
               investment in the production and development of alternative energy
               sources; The Synthetic Fuels Corporation has been established to help
               private companies build the facilities to produce energy from synthetic
               fuels; Solar energy funding has been quadrupled, solar energy tax
               credits enacted, and a Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank has
               been established; A route has been chosen to bring natural gas from the
               North Slope of Alaska to the lower 48 states; Coal production and
               consumption incentives have been increased, and coal production is now
               at its highest level in history; A gasoline rationing plan has been
               approved by Congress for possible use in the event of a severe energy
               supply shortage or interruption; Gasohol production has been
               dramatically increased, with a program being put in place to produce 500
               million gallons of alcohol fuel by the end of this year--an amount that
               could enable gasohol to meet the demand for 10 percent of all unleaded
               gasoline; New energy conservation incentives have been provided for
               individuals, businesses and communities and conservation has increased
               dramatically. The U.S. has reduced oil imports by 25 percent--or 2
               million barrels per day--over the past four years.</span></span></p>
      <p>INCREASED DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC ENERGY SOURCES</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Although it is essential that the Nation reduce its dependence on
            imported fossil fuels and complete the transition to reliance on
            domestic renewable sources of energy, it is also important that this
            transition be accomplished in an orderly, economic, and environmentally
            sound manner.</span> To this end, the Administration has launched several
         initiatives.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Leasing of oil and natural gas on federal lands, particularly the outer
            continental shelf, has been accelerated at the same time as the
            Administration has reformed leasing procedures through the 1978
            amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</span> In 1979 the
         Interior Department held six OCS lease sales, the greatest number ever,
         which resulted in federal receipts of $6.5 billion, another record. The
         five-year OCS Leasing schedule was completed, requiring 36 sales over
         the next five years.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Since 1971 no general federal coal lease sales were suspended. Over the
            past four years the Administration has completely revised the federal
            coal leasing program to bring it into compliance with the requirements
            of 1976 Federal Land Planning and Management Act and other statutory
            provisions.</span> The program is designed to balance the competing interests
         that affect resource development on public lands and to ensure that
         adequate supplies of coal will be available to meet national needs. As a
         result, the first general competitive federal coal lease sale in ten
         years will be held this month.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In July 1980, I signed into law the Energy Security Act of 1980 which
            established the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. The Corporation is designed
            to spur the development of commercial technologies for production of
            synthetic fuels, such as liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and the
            production of oil from oil shale.</span> The Act provides the Corporation with
         an initial $22 billion to accomplish these objectives. The principal
         purpose of the legislation is to ensure that the nation will have
         available in the late 1980's the option to undertake commercial
         development of synthetic fuels if that becomes necessary. The Energy
         Security Act also provides significant incentives for the development of
         gasohol and biomass fuels, thereby enhancing the nation's supply of
         alternative energy sources.</p>
      <p>COMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE</p>
      <p><span class="infra">The Administration's 1977 National Energy Plan marked an historic
            departure from the policies of previous Administrations. The plan
            stressed the importance of both energy production and conservation to
            achieving our ultimate national goal of relying primarily on secure
            sources of energy. The National Energy Plan made energy conservation a
            cornerstone of our national energy policy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">In 1978, I initiated the Administration's Solar Domestic Policy Review.
            This represented the first step towards widespread introduction of
            renewable energy sources into the Nation's economy. As a result of the
            Review, I issued the 1979 Solar Message to Congress, the first such
            message in the Nation's history. The Message outlined the
            Administration's solar program and established an ambitious national
            goal for the year 2000 of obtaining 20 percent of this Nation's energy
            from solar and renewable sources. The thrust of the federal solar
            program is to help industry develop solar energy sources by emphasizing
            basic research and development of solar technologies which are not
            currently economic, such as photovoltaics, which generate energy
            directly from the sun. At the same time, through tax incentives,
            education, and the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank, the solar
            program seeks to encourage state and local governments, industry, and
            our citizens to expand their use of solar and renewable resource
            technologies currently available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="economy">As a result of these policies and programs, the energy efficiency of the
               American economy has improved markedly and investments in renewable
               energy sources have grown significantly. It now takes 3 1/2 percent less
               energy to produce a constant dollar of GNP than it did in January 1977.
               This increase in efficiency represents a savings of over 1.3 million
               barrels per day of oil equivalent, about the level of total oil
               production now occurring in Alaska. Over the same period, Federal
               support for conservation and solar energy has increased by more than
               3000 percent, to $3.3 billion in FY 1981, including the tax credits for
               solar energy and energy conservation investments--these credits are
               expected to amount to $1.2 billion in FY 1981 and $1.5 billion in FY
               1982.</span></span></p>
      <p>COMMITMENT TO NUCLEAR SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="war">Since January 1977, significant progress has been achieved in resolving
               three critical problems resulting from the use of nuclear energy:
               radioactive waste management, nuclear safety and weapons proliferation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">In 1977, the Administration announced its nuclear nonproliferation
            policy and initiated the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation. In 1978,
            Congress passed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, an historic piece of
            legislation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">In February 1980, the Administration transmitted its nuclear waste
            management policy to the Congress. This policy was a major advance over
            all previous efforts.</span> The principal aspects of that policy are:
         acknowledging the seriousness of the problem and the numerous technical
         and institutional issues; adopting a technically and environmentally
         conservative approach to the first permanent repository; and providing
         the states with significant involvement in nuclear waste disposal
         decisions by creating the State Planning Council. While much of the plan
         can be and is being implemented administratively, some new authorities
         are needed. The Congress should give early priority to enacting
         provisions for away-from-reactor storage and the State Planning Council.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">The accident at Three Mile Island made the nation acutely aware of the
            safety risks posed by nuclear power plants.</span> In response, the President
         established the Kemeny Commission to review the accident and make
         recommendations. Virtually all of the Commission's substantive
         recommendations were adopted by the Administration and are now being
         implemented by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Congress adopted
         the President's proposed plan for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
         the Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee was established to ensure that
         the Administration's decisions were implemented.</p>
      <p>Nuclear safety will remain a vital concern in the years ahead. We must
         continue to press ahead for the safe, secure disposal of radioactive
         wastes, and prevention of nuclear proliferation.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">While significant growth in foreign demand for U.S. steam coal is
            foreseen, congestion must be removed at major U.S. coal exporting ports
            such as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland.</span> My
         Administration has worked through the Interagency Coal Task Force Study
         to promote cooperation and coordination of resources between shippers,
         railroads, vessel broker/ operators and port operators, and to determine
         the most appropriate Federal role in expanding and modernizing coal
         export facilities, including dredging deeper channels at selected ports.
         As a result of the Task Force's efforts, administrative steps have been
         taken by the Corps of Engineers to reduce significantly the amount of
         time required for planning and economic review of port dredging
         proposals. The Administration has also recommended that the Congress
         enact legislation to give the President generic authority to recommend
         appropriations for channel dredging activities. Private industry will,
         of course, play the major role in developing the United States' coal
         export facilities, but the government must continue to work to
         facilitate transportation to foreign markets.</p>
      <p>III. ENHANCING BASIC HUMAN AND SOCIAL NEEDS</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">For too long prior to my Administration, many of our Nation's basic
            human and social needs were being ignored or handled insensitively by
            the Federal government.</span> Over the last four years, we have significantly
         increased funding for many of the vital programs in these areas;
         developed new programs where needs were unaddressed; targeted Federal
         support to those individuals and areas most in need of our assistance;
         and removed barriers that have unnecessarily kept many disadvantaged
         citizens from obtaining aid for their most basic needs.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Our record has produced clear progress in the effort to solve some of
            the country's fundamental human and social problems. My Administration
            and the Congress, working together, have demonstrated that government
            must and can meet our citizens' basic human and social needs in a
            responsible and compassionate way.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">But there is an unfinished agenda still before the Congress. If we are
            to meet our obligations to help all Americans realize the dreams of
            sound health care, decent housing, effective social services, a good
            education, and a meaningful job, important legislation still must be
            enacted. National Health Insurance, Welfare Reform, Child Health
            Assessment Program, are before the Congress and I urge their passage.</span></p>
      <p>HEALTH NATIONAL HEALTH PLAN</p>
      <p>During my Administration, I proposed to Congress a National Health Plan
         which will enable the country to reach the goal of comprehensive,
         universal health care coverage. The legislation I submitted lays the
         foundation for this comprehensive plan and addresses the most serious
         problems of health financing and delivery. It is realistic and
         enactable. It does not overpromise or overspend, and, as a result, can
         be the solution to the thirty years of Congressional battles on national
         health insurance. My Plan includes the following key features:</p>
      <p>Nearly 15 million additional poor would receive fully-subsidized
         comprehensive coverage; pre-natal and delivery services are provided for
         all pregnant women and coverage is provided for all acute care for
         infants in their first year of life; the elderly and disabled would have
         a limit of $1,250 placed on annual out-of-pocket medical expenses and
         would no longer face limits on hospital coverage; all full-time
         employees and their families would receive insurance against at least
         major medical expenses under mandated employer coverage; Medicare and
         Medicaid would be combined and expanded into an umbrella Federal
         program, Healthcare, for increased program efficiency, accountability
         and uniformity; and strong cost controls and health system reforms would
         be implemented, including greater incentives for Health Maintenance
         Organizations.</p>
      <p>I urge the new Congress to compare my Plan with the
         alternatives--programs which either do too little to improve the health
         care needs of Americans most in need or programs which would impose
         substantial financial burdens on the American taxpayers. I hope the
         Congress will see the need for and the benefits of my Plan and work
         toward prompt enactment. We cannot afford further delay in this vital
         area.</p>
      <p>HEALTH CARE COST CONTROL</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Inflation in health care costs remains unacceptably high. Throughout my
            Administration, legislation to reduce health care cost inflation was one
            of my highest priorities, but was not passed by the Congress.</span> Therefore,
         my FY 1982 budget proposes sharing the responsibility for health care
         cost control with the private sector, through voluntary hospital cost
         guidelines and intensified monitoring. In the longer term, the health
         care reimbursement system must be reformed. We must move away from
         inflationary cost-based reimbursement and fee-for-service, and toward a
         system of prospective reimbursement, under which health care providers
         would operate within predetermined budgets. This reimbursement reform is
         essential to ultimately control inflation in health care costs, and will
         be a significant challenge to the new Congress.</p>
      <p>HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION</p>
      <p>During my Administration, the Surgeon General released "Healthy People,"
         a landmark report on health promotion and disease prevention. The report
         signals the growing consensus that the Nation's health strategy must be
         refocused in the 1980's to emphasize the prevention of disease.
         Specifically, the report lays out measurable and achieveable goals in
         the reduction of mortality which can be reached by 1990.</p>
      <p>I urge the new Congress to endorse the principles of "Healthy People,"
         and to adopt the recommendations to achieve its goals. This will
         necessitate adoption of a broader concept of health care, to include
         such areas as environmental health, workplace health and safety,
         commercial product safety, traffic safety, and health education,
         promotion and information.</p>
      <p>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH</p>
      <p>Ensuring a healthy start in life for children remains not only a high
         priority of my Administration, but also one of the most cost effective
         forms of health care.</p>
      <p>When I took office, immunization levels for preventable childhood
         diseases had fallen to 70%. As a result of a concerted nationwide effort
         during my Administration, I am pleased to report that now at least 90%
         of children under 15, and virtually all school-age children are
         immunized. In addition, reported cases of measles and mumps are at their
         lowest levels ever.</p>
      <p>Under the National Health Plan I have proposed, there would be no
         cost-sharing for prenatal and delivery services for all pregnant women
         and for acute care provided to infants in their first year of life.
         These preventive services have extremely high returns in terms of
         improved newborn and long-term child health.</p>
      <p>Under the Child Health Assurance Program (CHAP) legislation which I
         submitted to the Congress, and which passed the House, an additional two
         million low-income children under 18 would become eligible for Medicaid
         benefits, which would include special health assessments. CHAP would
         also improve the continuity of care for the nearly 14 million children
         now eligible for Medicaid. An additional 100,000 low-income pregnant
         women would become eligible for prenatal care under the proposal. I
         strongly urge the new Congress to enact CHAP and thereby provide
         millions of needy children with essential health services. The
         legislation has had strong bipartisan support, which should continue as
         the details of the bill are completed.</p>
      <p>I also urge the new Congress to provide strong support for two highly
         successful ongoing programs: the special supplemental food program for
         women, infants and children (WIC) and Family Planning. The food
         supplements under WIC have been shown to effectively prevent ill health
         and thereby reduce later medical costs. The Family Planning program has
         been effective at reducing unwanted pregnancies among low-income women
         and adolescents.</p>
      <p>EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO THE POOR AND UNDERSERVED</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">During my Administration, health services to the poor and underserved
            have been dramatically increased.</span> The number of National Health Service
         Corps (NHSC) assignees providing services in medically underserved
         communities has grown from 500 in 1977 to nearly 3,000 in 1981. The
         population served by the NHSC has more than tripled since 1977. The
         number of Community Health Centers providing services in high priority
         underserved areas has doubled during my Administration, and will serve
         an estimated six million people in 1981. I strongly urge the new
         Congress to support these highly successful programs.</p>
      <p>MENTAL HEALTH</p>
      <p>One of the most significant health achievements during my Administration
         was the recent passage of the Mental Health Systems Act, which grew out
         of recommendations of my Commission on Mental Health. I join many others
         in my gratitude to the First Lady for her tireless and effective
         contribution to the passage of this important legislation.</p>
      <p>The Act is designed to inaugurate a new era of Federal and State
         partnership in the planning and provision of mental health services. In
         addition, the Act specifically provides for prevention and support
         services to the chronically mentally ill to prevent unnecessary
         institutionalization and for the development of community-based mental
         health services. I urge the new Congress to provide adequate support for
         the full and timely implementation of this Act.</p>
      <p>HEALTH PROTECTION</p>
      <p>With my active support, the Congress recently passed "Medigap"
         legislation, which provides for voluntary certification of health
         insurance policies supplemental to Medicare, to curb widespread abuses
         in this area.</p>
      <p>In the area of toxic agent control, legislation which I submitted to the
         Congress recently passed. This will provide for a "super-fund" to cover
         hazardous waste cleanup costs.</p>
      <p>In the area of accidental injury control, we have established automobile
         safety standards and increased enforcement activities with respect to
         the 55 MPH speed limit. By the end of the decade these actions are
         expected to save over 13,000 lives and 100,000 serious injuries each
         year.</p>
      <p>I urge the new Congress to continue strong support for all these
         activities.</p>
      <p>FOOD AND NUTRITION</p>
      <p>Building on the comprehensive reform of the Food Stamp Program that I
         proposed and Congress passed in 1977, my Administration and the Congress
         worked together in 1979 and 1980 to enact several other important
         changes in the Program. These changes will further simplify
         administration and reduce fraud and error, will make the program more
         responsive to the needs of the elderly and disabled, and will increase
         the cap on allowable program expenditures. The Food Stamp Act will
         expire at the end of fiscal 1981. It is essential that the new
         Administration and the Congress continue this program to ensure complete
         eradication of the debilitating malnutrition witnessed and documented
         among thousands of children in the 1960's.</p>
      <p>DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION</p>
      <p>At the beginning of my Administration there were over a half million
         heroin addicts in the United States. Our continued emphasis on reducing
         the supply of heroin, as well as providing treatment and rehabilitation
         to its victims, has reduced the heroin addict population, reduced the
         number of heroin overdose deaths by 80%, and reduced the number of
         heroin related injuries by 50%. We have also seen and encouraged a
         national movement of parents and citizens committed to reversing the
         very serious and disturbing trends of adolescent drug abuse.</p>
      <p>Drug abuse in many forms will continue to detract, however, from the
         quality of life of many Americans. To prevent that, I see four great
         challenges in the years ahead. First, we must deal aggressively with the
         supplies of illegal drugs at their source, through joint crop
         destruction programs with foreign nations and increased law enforcement
         and border interdiction. Second, we must look to citizens and parents
         across the country to help educate the increasing numbers of American
         youth who are experimenting with drugs to the dangers of drug abuse.
         Education is a key factor in reducing drug abuse. Third, we must focus
         our efforts on drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace for not only does
         this abuse contribute to low productivity but it also destroys the
         satisfaction and sense of purpose all Americans can gain from the work
         experience. Fourth, we need a change in attitude, from an attitude which
         condones the casual use of drugs to one that recognizes the appropriate
         use of drugs for medical purposes and condemns the inappropriate and
         harmful abuse of drugs. I hope the Congress and the new Administration
         will take action to meet each of these challenges.</p>
      <p>EDUCATION</p>
      <p><span class="infra">The American people have always recognized that education is one of the
            soundest investments they can make.</span> The dividends are reflected in every
         dimension of our national life--from the strength of our economy and
         national security to the vitality of our music, art, and literature.
         Among the accomplishments that have given me the most satisfaction over
         the last four years are the contributions that my Administration has
         been able to make to the well-being of students and educators throughout
         the country.</p>
      <p>This Administration has collaborated successfully with the Congress on
         landmark education legislation. Working with the Congressional
         leadership, my Administration spotlighted the importance of education by
         creating a new Department of Education. The Department has given
         education a stronger voice at the Federal level, while at the same time
         reserving the actual control and operation of education to states,
         localities, and private institutions. The Department has successfully
         combined nearly 150 Federal education programs into a cohesive,
         streamlined organization that is more responsive to the needs of
         educators and students. The Department has made strides to cut red tape
         and paperwork and thereby to make the flow of Federal dollars to school
         districts and institutions of higher education more efficient. It is
         crucial that the Department be kept intact and strengthened.</p>
      <p>Our collaboration with the Congress has resulted in numerous other
         important legislative accomplishments for education. A little over two
         years ago, I signed into law on the same day two major bills--one
         benefiting elementary and secondary education and the other,
         postsecondary education. The Education Amendments of 1978 embodied
         nearly all of my Administration's proposals for improvements in the
         Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including important new programs
         to improve students' achievement in the basic skills and to aid school
         districts with exceptionally high concentrations of children from
         low-income families. The Middle Income Student Assistance Act,
         legislation jointly sponsored by this Administration and the
         Congressional leadership, expanded eligibility for need-based Basic
         Educational Opportunity Grants to approximately one-third of the
         students enrolled in post-secondary education and made many more
         students eligible for the first time for other types of grants,
         work-study, and loans.</p>
      <p>Just three and a half months ago, my Administration and the Congress
         successfully concluded over two years of work on a major reauthorization
         bill that further expands benefits to postsecondary education. Reflected
         in the Education Amendments of 1980 are major Administration
         recommendations for improvements in the Higher Education Act--including
         proposals for better loan access for students; a new parent loan
         program; simplified application procedures for student financial aid; a
         strengthened Federal commitment to developing colleges, particularly the
         historically Black institutions; a new authorization for equipment and
         facilities modernization funding for the nation's major research
         universities; and revitalized international education programs.</p>
      <p>Supplementing these legislative accomplishments have been important
         administrative actions aimed at reducing paperwork and simplifying
         regulations associated with Federal education programs. We also launched
         major initiatives to reduce the backlog of defaulted student loans and
         otherwise to curb fraud, abuse, and waste in education programs.</p>
      <p>To insure that the education enterprise is ready to meet the scientific
         and technological changes of the future, we undertook a major study of
         the status of science and engineering education throughout the nation. I
         hope that the findings from this report will serve as a springboard for
         needed reforms at all levels of education.</p>
      <p>I am proud that this Administration has been able to provide the
         financial means to realize many of our legislative and administrative
         goals. Compared to the previous administration's last budget, I have
         requested the largest overall increase in Federal funding for education
         in our nation's history. My budget requests have been particularly
         sensitive to the needs of special populations like minorities, women,
         the educationally and economically disadvantaged, the handicapped, and
         students with limited English-speaking ability. At the same time, I have
         requested significant increases for many programs designed to enhance
         the quality of American education, including programs relating to
         important areas as diverse as international education, research
         libraries, museums, and teacher centers.</p>
      <p>Last year, I proposed to the Congress a major legislative initiative
         that would direct $2 billion into education and job training programs
         designed to alleviate youth unemployment through improved linkages
         between the schools and the work place. This legislation generated
         bipartisan support; but unfortunately, action on it was not completed in
         the final, rushed days of the 96th Congress. I urge the new Congress--as
         it undertakes broad efforts to strengthen the economy as well as more
         specific tasks like reauthorizing the Vocational Education Act--to make
         the needs of our nation's unemployed youth a top priority for action.
         Only by combining a basic skills education program together with work
         training and employment incentives can we make substantial progress in
         eliminating one of the most severe social problems in our nation--youth
         unemployment, particularly among minorities. I am proud of the progress
         already made through passage of the Youth Employment and Demonstration
         Project Act of 1977 and the substantial increase in our investment in
         youth employment programs. The new legislation would cap these efforts.</p>
      <p>INCOME SECURITY SOCIAL SECURITY</p>
      <p>One of the highest priorities of my Administration has been to continue
         the tradition of effectiveness and efficiency widely associated with the
         social security program, and to assure present and future beneficiaries
         that they will receive their benefits as expected. The earned benefits
         that are paid monthly to retired and disabled American workers and their
         families provide a significant measure of economic protection to
         millions of people who might otherwise face retirement or possible
         disability with fear. I have enacted changes to improve the benefits of
         many social security beneficiaries during my years as President.</p>
      <p>The last four years have presented a special set of concerns over the
         financial stability of the social security system. Shortly after taking
         office I proposed and Congress enacted legislation to protect the
         stability of the old age and survivors trust fund and prevent the
         imminent exhaustion of the disability insurance trust fund, and to
         correct a flaw in the benefit formula that was threatening the long run
         health of the entire social security system. The actions taken by the
         Congress at my request helped stabilize the system. That legislation was
         later complemented by the Disability Insurance Amendments of 1980 which
         further bolstered the disability insurance program, and reduced certain
         inequities among beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>My commitment to the essential retirement and disability protection
         provided to 35 million people each month has been demonstrated by the
         fact that without interruption those beneficiaries have continued to
         receive their social security benefits, including annual cost of living
         increases. Changing and unpredictable economic circumstances require
         that we continue to monitor the financial stability of the social
         security system. To correct anticipated short-term strains on the
         system, I proposed last year that the three funds be allowed to borrow
         from one another, and I urge the Congress again this year to adopt such
         interfund borrowing. To further strengthen the social security system
         and provide a greater degree of assurance to beneficiaries, given
         projected future economic uncertainties, additional action should be
         taken. Among the additional financing options available are borrowing
         from the general fund, financing half of the hospital insurance fund
         with general revenues, and increasing the payroll tax rate. The latter
         option is particularly unpalatable given the significant increase in the
         tax rate already mandated in law.</p>
      <p>This Administration continues to oppose cuts in basic social security
         benefits and taxing social security benefits. The Administration
         continues to support annual indexing of social security benefits.</p>
      <p>WELFARE REFORM</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">In 1979 I proposed a welfare reform package which offers solutions to
            some of the most urgent problems in our welfare system. This proposal is
            embodied in two bills, The Work and Training Opportunities Act and The
            Social Welfare Reform Amendments Act. The House passed the second of
            these two proposals. Within the framework of our present welfare system,
            my reform proposals offer achievable means to increase self-sufficiency
            through work rather than welfare, more adequate assistance to people
            unable to work, the removal of inequities in coverage under current
            programs, and fiscal relief needed by States and localities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Our current welfare system is long overdue for serious reform; the
            system is wasteful and not fully effective. The legislation I have
            proposed will help eliminate inequities by establishing a national
            minimum benefit, and by directly relating benefit levels to the poverty
            threshold.</span> It will reduce program complexity, which leads to
         inefficiency and waste, by simplifying and coordinating administration
         among different programs.</p>
      <p>I urge the Congress to take action in this area along the lines I have
         recommended.</p>
      <p>CHILD WELFARE</p>
      <p>My Administration has worked closely with the Congress on legislation
         which is designed to improve greatly the child welfare services and
         foster care programs and to create a Federal system of adoption
         assistance. These improvements will be achieved with the recent
         enactment of H.R. 3434, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of
         1980. The well-being of children in need of homes and their permanent
         placement have been a primary concern of my Administration. This
         legislation will ensure that children are not lost in the foster care
         system, but instead will be returned to their families where possible or
         placed in permanent adoptive homes.</p>
      <p>LOW-INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">In 1979 I proposed a program to provide an annual total of $1.6 billion
            to low-income households which are hardest hit by rising energy bills.
            With the cooperation of Congress, we were able to move quickly to
            provide assistance to eligible households in time to meet their winter
            heating bills.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">In response to the extreme heat conditions affecting many parts of the
            country during 1980, I directed the Community Services Administration to
            make available over $27 million to assist low-income individuals,
            especially the elderly, facing life threatening circumstances due to
            extreme heat.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Congress amended and reauthorized the low-income energy assistance
            program for fiscal year 1981, and provided $1.85 billion to meet
            anticipated increasing need.</span> <span class="poverty">The need for a program to help low-income
            households with rising energy expenses will not abate in the near
            future. The low-income energy assistance program should be reauthorized
            to meet those needs.</span></p>
      <p>HOUSING</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For the past 14 months, high interest rates have had a severe impact on
            the nation's housing market. Yet the current pressures and uncertainties
            should not obscure the achievements of the past four years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Working with the Congress, the regulatory agencies, and the financial
            community, my Administration has brought about an expanded and steadier
            flow of funds into home mortgages.</span> Deregulation of the interest rates
         payable by depository institutions, the evolution of variable and
         renegotiated rate mortgages, development of high yielding savings
         certificates, and expansion of the secondary mortgage market have all
         increased housing's ability to attract capital and have assured that
         mortgage money would not be cut off when interest rates rose. These
         actions will diminish the cyclicality of the housing industry. Further,
         we have secured legislation updating the Federal Government's emergency
         authority to provide support for the housing industry through the
         Brooke-Cranston program, and creating a new Section 235 housing stimulus
         program. These tools will enable the Federal Government to deal quickly
         and effectively with serious distress in this critical industry.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have also worked to expand homeownership opportunities for Americans.
            By using innovative financing mechanisms, such as the graduated payment
            mortgage, we have increased the access of middle income families to
            housing credit. By revitalizing the Section 235 program, we have enabled
            nearly 100,000 moderate income households to purchase new homes</span>. By
         reducing paperwork and regulation in Federal programs, and by working
         with State and local governments to ease the regulatory burden, we have
         helped to hold down housing costs and produce affordable housing.</p>
      <p>As a result of these governmentwide efforts, 5 1/2 million more American
         families bought homes in the past four years than in any equivalent
         period in history. <span class="infra">And more than 7 million homes have begun construction
            during my Administration, 1 million more than in the previous four
            years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We have devoted particular effort to meeting the housing needs of low
            and moderate income families. In the past four years, more than 1
            million subsidized units have been made available for occupancy by lower
            income Americans and more than 600,000 assisted units have gone into
            construction. In addition, we have undertaken a series of measures to
            revitalize and preserve the nation's 2 million units of public and
            assisted housing.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">For Fiscal Year 1982, I am proposing to continue our commitment to lower
            income housing. I am requesting funds to support 260,000 units of
            Section 8 and public housing, maintaining these programs at the level
            provided by Congress in Fiscal 1981.</span></p>
      <p>While we have made progress in the past four years, in the future there
         are reasons for concern. <span class="economy">Home price inflation and high interest rates
            threaten to put homeownership out of reach for first-time homebuyers.
            Lower income households, the elderly and those dependent upon rental
            housing face rising rents, low levels of rental housing construction by
            historic standards, and the threat of displacement due to conversion to
            condominiums and other factors.</span> Housing will face strong competition for
         investment capital from the industrial sector generally and the energy
         industries, in particular.</p>
      <p>To address these issues, I appointed a Presidential Task Force and
         Advisory Group last October. While this effort will not proceed due to
         the election result, I hope the incoming Administration will proceed
         with a similar venture.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The most important action government can take to meet America's housing
            needs is to restore stability to the economy and bring down the rate of
            inflation. Inflation has driven up home prices, operating costs and
            interest rates. Market uncertainty about inflation has contributed to
            the instability in interest rates, which has been an added burden to
            homebuilders and homebuyers alike. By making a long-term commitment to
            provide a framework for greater investment, sustained economic growth,
            and price stability, my Administration has begun the work of creating a
            healthy environment for housing.</span></p>
      <p>TRANSPORTATION</p>
      <p><span class="infra">With the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the Motor
            Carrier Act of 1980, and the Harley O. Staggers Rail Act of 1980, my
            Administration, working with the Congress, has initiated a new era of
            reduced regulation of transportation industries. Deregulation will lead
            to increased productivity and operating efficiencies in the industries
            involved, and stimulate price and service competition, to the benefit of
            consumers generally.</span> I urge the new Administration to continue our
         efforts on behalf of deregulation legislation for the intercity
         passenger bus industry as well.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In the coming decade, the most significant challenge facing the nation
            in transportation services will be to improve a deteriorating physical
            infrastructure of roadways, railroads, waterways and mass transit
            systems, in order to conserve costly energy supplies while promoting
            effective transportation services.</span></p>
      <p>HIGHWAYS</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our vast network of highways, which account for 90 percent of travel and
            80 percent by value of freight traffic goods movement, is deteriorating.
            If current trends continue, a major proportion of the Interstate
            pavement will have deteriorated by the end of the 1980's.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Arresting the deterioration of the nation's system of highways is a high
            priority objective for the 1980's. We must reorient the Federal mission
            from major new construction projects to the stewardship of the existing
            Interstate Highway System. Interstate gaps should be judged on the
            connections they make and on their compatibility with community needs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">During this decade, highway investments will be needed to increase
            productivity, particularly in the elimination of bottlenecks, provide
            more efficient connections to ports and seek low-cost solutions to
            traffic demand.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">My Administration has therefore recommended redefining completion of the
            Interstate system, consolidating over 27 categorical assistance programs
            into nine, and initiating a major repair and rehabilitation program for
            segments of the Interstate system. This effort should help maintain the
            condition and performance of the Nation's highways, particularly the
            Interstate and primary system; provide a realistic means to complete the
            Interstate system by 1990; ensure better program delivery through
            consolidation, and assist urban revitalization.</span> In addition, the
         Congress must address the urgent funding problems of the highway trust
         fund, and the need to generate greater revenues.</p>
      <p>MASS TRANSIT</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In the past decade the nation's public transit systems' ridership
            increased at an annual average of 1.1% each year in the 1970's (6.9% in
            1979). Continued increases in the cost of fuel are expected to make
            transit a growing part of the nation's transportation system.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">As a result, my Administration projected a ten year, $43 billion program
            to increase mass transit capacity by 50 percent, and promote more energy
            efficient vehicle uses in the next decade. The first part of this
            proposal was the five year, $24.7 billion Urban Mass Transportation
            Administration reauthorization legislation I sent to the Congress in
            March, 1980. I urge the 97th Congress to quickly enact this or similar
            legislation in 1981.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">My Administration was also the first to have proposed and signed into
            law a non-urban formula grant program to assist rural areas and small
            communities with public transportation programs to end their dependence
            on the automobile, promote energy conservation and efficiency, and
            provide transportation services to impoverished rural communities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">A principal need of the 1980's will be maintaining mobility for all
            segments of the population in the face of severely increasing
            transportation costs and uncertainty of fuel supplies. We must improve
            the flexibility of our transportation system and offer greater choice
            and diversity in transportation services. While the private automobile
            will continue to be the principal means of transportation for many
            Americans, public transportation can become an increasingly attractive
            alternative. We, therefore, want to explore a variety of paratransit
            modes, various types of buses, modern rapid transit, regional rail
            systems and light rail systems.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Highway planning and transit planning must be integrated and related to
            State, regional, district and neighborhood planning efforts now in place
            or emerging. Low density development and land use threaten the fiscal
            capacity of many communities to support needed services and
            infrastructure.</span></p>
      <p>ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED TRANSPORTATION</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Transportation policies in the 1980's must pay increasing attention to
            the needs of the elderly and handicapped. By 1990, the number of people
            over 65 will have grown from today's 19 million to 27 million. During
            the same period, the number of handicapped--people who have difficulty
            using transit as well as autos, including the elderly--is expected to
            increase from 9 to 11 million, making up 4.5 percent of the population.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We must not retreat from a policy that affords a significant and growing
            portion of our population accessible public transportation while
            recognizing that the handicapped are a diverse group and will need
            flexible, door-to-door service where regular public transportation will
            not do the job.</span></p>
      <p>RAILROADS</p>
      <p><span class="infra">In addition, the Federal government must reassess the appropriate
            Federal role of support for passenger and freight rail services such as
            Amtrak and Conrail. Our goal through federal assistance should be to
            maintain and enhance adequate rail service, where it is not otherwise
            available to needy communities.</span> But Federal subsidies must be closely
         scrutinized to be sure they are a stimulus to, and not a replacement
         for, private investment and initiative. Federal assistance cannot mean
         permanent subsidies for unprofitable operations.</p>
      <p>WATERWAYS AND RURAL TRANSPORTATION</p>
      <p><span class="infra">There is a growing need in rural and small communities for improved
            transportation services. Rail freight service to many communities has
            declined as railroads abandon unproductive branch lines. At the same
            time, rural roads are often inadequate to handle large, heavily-loaded
            trucks. The increased demand for "harvest to harbor" service has also
            placed an increased burden on rural transportation systems, while
            bottlenecks along the Mississippi River delay grain shipments to the
            Gulf of Mexico.</span></p>
      <p>We have made some progress:</p>
      <p><span class="infra">--To further develop the nation's waterways, my Administration began
            construction of a new 1,200 foot lock at the site of Lock and Dam 26 on
            the Mississippi River. When opened in 1987, the new lock will have a
            capacity of 86 million tons per year, an 18 percent increase over the
            present system. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has also undertaken
            studies to assess the feasibility of expanding the Bonneville Locks.
            Rehabilitation of John Day Lock was begun in 1980 and should be
            completed in 1982. My Administration also supports the completion of the
            Upper Mississippi River Master Plan to determine the feasibility of
            constructing a second lock at Alton, Illinois. These efforts will help
            alleviate delays in transporting corn, soybeans and other goods along
            the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">--The Department of Transportation's new Small Community and Rural
            Transportation Policy will target federal assistance for passenger
            transportation, roads and highways, truck service, and railroad freight
            service to rural areas. This policy implements and expands upon the
            earlier White House Initiative, "Improving Transportation in Rural
            America," announced in June, 1979, and the President's "Small Community
            and Rural Development Policy" announced in December, 1979. The Congress
            should seek ways to balance rail branch line abandonment with the
            service needs of rural and farm communities, provide financial
            assistance to rail branch line rehabilitation where appropriate, assist
            shippers to adjust to rail branch line abandonment where it takes place,
            and help make it possible for trucking firms to serve light density
            markets with dependable and efficient trucking services.</span></p>
      <p>MARITIME POLICY</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">During my Administration I have sought to ensure that the U.S. maritime
            industry will not have to function at an unfair competitive disadvantage
            in the international market. As I indicated in my maritime policy
            statement to the Congress in July, 1979, the American merchant marine is
            vital to our Nation's welfare, and Federal actions should promote rather
            than harm it. In pursuit of this objective, I signed into law the
            Controlled Carrier Act of 1978, authorizing the Federal Maritime
            Commission to regulate certain rate cutting practices of some
            state-controlled carriers, and recently signed a bilateral maritime
            agreement with the People's Republic of China that will expand the
            access of American ships to 20 specified Chinese ports, and set aside
            for American-flag ships a substantial share (at least one-third) of the
            cargo between our countries. This agreement should officially foster
            expanded U.S. and Chinese shipping services linking the two countries,
            and will provide further momentum to the growth of Sino-American trade.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">There is also a need to modernize and expand the dry bulk segment of our
            fleet. Our heavy dependence on foreign carriage of U.S.-bulk cargoes
            deprives the U.S. economy of seafaring and shipbuilding jobs, adds to
            the balance-of-payments deficit, deprives the Government of substantial
            tax revenues, and leaves the United States dependent on foreign-flag
            shipping for a continued supply of raw materials to support the civil
            economy and war production in time of war.</span></p>
      <p>I therefore sent to the Congress proposed legislation to strengthen this
         woefully weak segment of the U.S.-flag fleet by removing certain
         disincentives to U.S. construction of dry bulkers and their operation
         under U.S. registry. Enactment of this proposed legislation would
         establish the basis for accelerating the rebuilding of the U.S.-flag dry
         bulk fleet toward a level commensurate with the position of the United
         States as the world's leading bulk trading country.</p>
      <p>During the past year the Administration has stated its support for
         legislation that would provide specific Federal assistance for the
         installation of fuel-efficient engines in existing American ships, and
         would strengthen this country's shipbuilding mobilization base.
         Strengthening the fleet is important, but we must also maintain our
         shipbuilding base for future ship construction.</p>
      <p>Provisions in existing laws calling for substantial or exclusive use of
         American-flag vessels to carry cargoes generated by the Government must
         be vigorously pursued.</p>
      <p>I have therefore supported requirements that 50 percent of oil purchased
         for the strategic petroleum reserve be transported in U.S.-flag vessels,
         that the Cargo Preference Act be applied to materials furnished for the
         U.S. assisted construction of air bases in Israel, and to cargoes
         transported pursuant to the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act. In
         addition, the deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act requires that at
         least one ore carrier per mine site be a U.S.-flag vessel.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Much has been done, and much remains to be done. The FY 1982 budget
            includes a $107 million authorization for Construction Differential
            Subsidy ("CDS") funds which, added to the unobligated CDS balance of
            $100 million from 1980, and the recently enacted $135 million 1981
            authorization, will provide an average of $171 million in CDS funds in
            1981 and 1982.</span></p>
      <p>COAL EXPORT POLICY</p>
      <p><span class="infra">While significant growth in foreign demand for U.S. steam coal is
            foreseen, congestion at major U.S. coal exporting ports such as Hampton
            Roads, Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland, could delay and impede
            exports.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">My Administration has worked through the Interagency Coal Task Force
            Study, which I created, to promote cooperation and coordination of
            resources between shippers, railroads, vessel broker/ operators and port
            operators, and to determine the most appropriate Federal role in
            expanding and modernizing coal export facilities, including dredging
            deeper channels at selected ports.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Some progress has already been made. In addition to action taken by
            transshippers to reduce the number of coal classifications used whenever
            possible, by the Norfolk and Western Railroad to upgrade its computer
            capability to quickly inventory its coal cars in its yards, and by the
            Chessie Railroad which is reactivating Pier 15 in Newport News and has
            established a berth near its Curtis Bay Pier in Baltimore to decrease
            delays in vessel berthing, public activities will include:</span></p>
      <p>--A $26.5 million plan developed by the State of Pennsylvania and
         Conrail to increase Conrail's coal handling capacity at Philadelphia;</p>
      <p>--A proposal by the State of Virginia to construct a steam coal port on
         the Craney Island Disposal area in Portsmouth harbor;</p>
      <p>--Plans by Mobile, Alabama, which operates the only publicly owned coal
         terminal in the U.S. to enlarge its capacity at McDuffie Island to 10
         million tons ground storage and 100 car unit train unloading capability;</p>
      <p>--Development at New Orleans of steam coal facilities that are expected
         to add over 20 million tons of annual capacity by 1983; and</p>
      <p>--The Corps of Engineers, working with other interested Federal
         agencies, will determine which ports should be dredged, to what depth
         and on what schedule, in order to accommodate larger coal carrying
         vessels.</p>
      <p>Private industry will, of course, play a major role in developing the
         United States' coal export facilities. The new Administration should
         continue to work to eliminate transportation bottlenecks that impede our
         access to foreign markets.</p>
      <p>Special Needs</p>
      <p>WOMEN</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The past four years have been years of rapid advancement for women. Our
            focus has been two-fold: to provide American women with a full range of
            opportunities and to make them a part of the mainstream of every aspect
            of our national life and leadership.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I have appointed a record number of women to judgeships and to top
            government posts. Fully 22 percent of all my appointees are women, and I
            nominated 41 of the 46 women who sit on the Federal bench today. For the
            first time in our history, women occupy policymaking positions at the
            highest level of every Federal agency and department and have
            demonstrated their ability to serve our citizens well.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We have strengthened the rights of employed women by consolidating and
            strengthening enforcement of sex discrimination laws under the EEOC, by
            expanding employment rights of pregnant women through the Pregnancy
            Disability Bill, and by increasing federal employment opportunities for
            women through civil service reform, and flexi-time and part-time
            employment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">By executive order, I created the first national program to provide
            women businessowners with technical assistance, grants, loans, and
            improved access to federal contracts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We have been sensitive to the needs of women who are homemakers. I
            established an Office of Families within HHS and sponsored the White
            House Conference on Families. We initiated a program targeting CETA
            funds to help displaced homemakers. The Social Security system was
            amended to eliminate the widow's penalty and a comprehensive study of
            discriminatory provisions and possible changes was presented to
            Congress. Legislation was passed to give divorced spouses of foreign
            service officers rights to share in pension benefits.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We created an office on domestic violence within HHS to coordinate the
            12 agencies that now have domestic violence relief programs, and to
            distribute information on the problem and the services available to
            victims.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Despite a stringent budget for FY 1981, the Administration consistently
            supported the Women's Educational Equity Act and family planning
            activities, as well as other programs that affect women, such as food
            stamps, WIC, and social security.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We have been concerned not only about the American woman's
            opportunities, but ensuring equality for women around the world. In
            November, 1980, I sent to the Senate the Convention on the Elimination
            of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This United Nations
            document is the most comprehensive and detailed international agreement
            which seeks the advancement of women.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">On women's issues, I have sought the counsel of men and women in and out
            of government and from all regions of our country. I established two
            panels-- the President's Advisory Committee for Women and the
            Interdepartmental Task Force on Women--to advise me on these issues. The
            mandate for both groups expired on December 31, but they have left
            behind a comprehensive review of the status of women in our society
            today. That review provides excellent guidance for the work remaining in
            our battle against sex discrimination.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Even though we have made progress, much remains on the agenda for women.
            I remain committed to the Equal Rights Amendment and will continue to
            work for its passage. It is essential to the goal of bringing America's
            women fully into the mainstream of American life that the ERA be
            ratified.</span></p>
      <p>The efforts begun for women in employment, business and education should
         be continued and strengthened. Money should be available to states to
         establish programs to help the victims of domestic violence. Congress
         should pass a national health care plan and a welfare reform program,
         and these measures should reflect the needs of women.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The talents of women should continue to be used to the fullest inside
            and outside of government, and efforts should continue to see that they
            have the widest range of opportunities and options.</span></p>
      <p>HANDICAPPED</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I hope that my Administration will be remembered in this area for
            leading the way toward full civil rights for handicapped Americans. When
            I took office, no federal agency had yet issued 504 regulations. As I
            leave office, this first step by every major agency and department in
            the federal government is almost complete. But it is only a first step.
            The years ahead will require steadfast dedication by the President to
            protect and promote these precious rights in the classroom, in the
            workplace, and in all public facilities so that handicapped individuals
            may join the American mainstream and contribute to the fullest their
            resources and talents to our economic and social life.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Just as we supported, in an unprecedented way, the civil rights of
            disabled persons in schools and in the workplace, other initiatives in
            health prevention, such as our immunization and nutrition programs for
            young children and new intense efforts to reverse spinal cord injury,
            must continue so that the incidence of disability continues to decline.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">This year is the U.N.-declared International Year of Disabled Persons.
            We are organizing activities to celebrate and promote this important
            commemorative year within the government as well as in cooperation with
            private sector efforts in this country and around the world.</span> The
         International Year will give our country the opportunity to recognize
         the talents and capabilities of our fellow citizens with disabilities.
         We can also share our rehabilitation and treatment skills with other
         countries and learn from them as well. I am proud that the United States
         leads the world in mainstreaming and treating disabled people. However,
         we have a long way to go before all psychological and physical barriers
         to disabled people are torn down and they can be full participants in
         our American way of life. We must pledge our full commitment to this
         goal during the International Year.</p>
      <p>FAMILIES</p>
      <p>Because of my concern for American families, my Administration convened
         last year the first White House Conference on Families which involved
         seven national hearings, over 506 state and local events, three White
         House Conferences, and the direct participation of more than 125,000
         citizens. The Conference reaffirmed the centrality of families in our
         lives and nation but documented problems American families face as well.
         We also established the Office of Families within the Department of
         Health and Human Services to review government policies and programs
         that affect families.</p>
      <p>I expect the departments and agencies within the executive branch of the
         Federal government as well as Members of Congress, corporate and
         business leaders, and State and local officials across the country, to
         study closely the recommendations of the White House Conference and
         implement them appropriately. As public policy is developed and
         implemented by the Federal government, cognizance of the work of the
         Conference should be taken as a pragmatic and essential step.</p>
      <p>The Conference has done a good job of establishing an agenda for action
         to assure that the policies of the Federal government are more sensitive
         in their impact on families. I hope the Congress will review and
         seriously consider the Conference's recommendations.</p>
      <p>OLDER AMERICANS</p>
      <p>My Administration has taken great strides toward solving the difficult
         problems faced by older Americans. Early in my term we worked
         successfully with the Congress to assure adequate revenues for the
         Social Security Trust Funds. And last year the strength of the Social
         Security System was strengthened by legislation I proposed to permit
         borrowing among the separate trust funds. I have also signed into law
         legislation prohibiting employers from requiring retirement prior to age
         70, and removing mandatory retirement for most Federal employees. In
         addition, my Administration worked very closely with Congress to amend
         the Older Americans Act in a way that has already improved
         administration of its housing, social services, food delivery, and
         employment programs.</p>
      <p>This year, I will be submitting to Congress a budget which again
         demonstrates my commitment to programs for the elderly. It will include,
         as my previous budgets have, increased funding for nutrition, senior
         centers and home health care, and will focus added resources on the
         needs of older Americans.</p>
      <p>With the 1981 White House Conference on Aging approaching, I hope the
         new Administration will make every effort to assure an effective and
         useful conference. This Conference should enable older Americans to
         voice their concerns and give us guidance in our continued efforts to
         ensure the quality of life so richly deserved by our senior citizens.</p>
      <p>REFUGEES</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We cannot hope to build a just and humane society at home if we ignore
            the humanitarian claims of refugees, their lives at stake, who have
            nowhere else to turn. Our country can be proud that hundreds of
            thousands of people around the world would risk everything they
            have--including their own lives--to come to our country.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">This Administration initiated and implemented the first comprehensive
            reform of our refugee and immigration policies in over 25 years.</span> We also
         established the first refugee coordination office in the Department of
         State under the leadership of a special ambassador and coordinator for
         refugee affairs and programs. The new legislation and the coordinator's
         office will bring common sense and consolidation to our Nation's
         previously fragmented, inconsistent, and in many ways, outdated, refugee
         and immigration policies.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">With the unexpected arrival of thousands of Cubans and Haitians who
            sought refuge in our country last year, outside of our regular
            immigration and refugee admissions process, our country and its
            government were tested in being compassionate and responsive to a major
            human emergency.</span> Because we had taken steps to reorganize our refugee
         programs, we met that test successfully. I am proud that the American
         people responded to this crisis with their traditional good will and
         hospitality. Also, we would never have been able to handle this
         unprecedented emergency without the efforts of the private resettlement
         agencies who have always been there to help refugees in crises.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Immigrants to this country always contribute more toward making our
            country stronger than they ever take from the system. I am confident
            that the newest arrivals to our country will carry on this tradition.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">While we must remain committed to aiding and assisting those who come to
            our shores, at the same time we must uphold our immigration and refugee
            policies and provide adequate enforcement resources. As a result of our
            enforcement policy, the illegal flow from Cuba has been halted and an
            orderly process has been initiated to make certain that our refugee and
            immigration laws are honored.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">This year the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy will
            complete its work and forward its advice and recommendations.</span> I hope
         that the recommendations will be carefully considered by the new
         Administration and the Congress, for it is clear that we must take
         additional action to keep our immigration policy responsive to
         emergencies and ever changing times.</p>
      <p>VETERANS</p>
      <p><span class="war">This country and its leadership has a continuing and unique obligation
            to the men and women who served their nation in the armed forces and
            help maintain or restore peace in the world.</span></p>
      <p>My commitment to veterans, as evidenced by my record, is characterized
         by a conscientious and consistent emphasis in these general areas:</p>
      <p><span class="war">First, we have worked to honor the Vietnam veteran. During my
            Administration, and under the leadership of VA Administrator Max
            Cleland, I was proud to lead our country in an overdue acknowledgement
            of our Nation's gratitude to the men and women who served their country
            during the bitter war in Southeast Asia.</span> Their homecoming was deferred
         and seemed doomed to be ignored. Our country has matured in the last
         four years and at long last we were able to separate the war from the
         warrior and honor these veterans. But with our acknowledgement of their
         service goes an understanding that some Vietnam veterans have unique
         needs and problems.</p>
      <p><span class="war">My Administration was able to launch a long sought after psychological
            readjustment and outreach program, unprecedented in its popularity,
            sensitivity and success. This program must be continued. The
            Administration has also grappled with the difficult questions posed by
            some veterans who served in Southeast Asia and were exposed to
            potentially harmful substances, including the herbicide known as Agent
            Orange. We have launched scientific inquiries that should answer many
            veterans' questions about their health and should provide the basis for
            establishing sound compensation polic.</span> We cannot rest until their
         concerns are dealt with in a sensitive, expeditious and compassionate
         fashion.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Second, we have focused the VA health care system in the needs of the
            service-connected disabled veteran. We initiated and are implementing
            the first reform of the VA vocational rehabilitation system since its
            inception in 1943.</span> Also, my Administration was the first to seek a
         cost-of-living increase for the recipients of VA compensation every
         year. My last budget also makes such a request. The Administration also
         launched the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program in the Department of
         Labor which has successfully placed disabled veterans in jobs. Services
         provided by the VA health care system will be further targeted to the
         special needs of disabled veterans during the coming year.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Third, the VA health care system, the largest in the free world, has
            maintained its independence and high quality during my Administration.
            We have made the system more efficient and have therefore treated more
            veterans than ever before by concentrating on out-patient care and
            through modern management improvements.</span> As the median age of the
         American veteran population increases, we must concentrate on further
         changes within the VA system to keep it independent and to serve as a
         model to the nation and to the world as a center for research, treatment
         and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>Government Assistance</p>
      <p>GENERAL AID TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Since taking office, I have been strongly committed to strengthening the
            fiscal and economic condition of our Nation's State and local
            governments. I have accomplished this goal by encouraging economic
            development of local communities, and by supporting the General Revenue
            Sharing and other essential grant-in-aid programs.</span></p>
      <p>GRANTS-IN-AID TO STATES AND LOCALITIES</p>
      <p><span class="economy">During my Administration, total grants-in-aid to State and local
            governments have increased by more than 40 percent, from $68 billion in
            Fiscal Year 1977 to $96 billion in Fiscal Year 1981. This significant
            increase in aid has allowed States and localities to maintain services
            that are essential to their citizens without imposing onerous tax
            burdens.</span> It also has allowed us to establish an unprecedented
         partnership between the leaders of the Federal government and State and
         local government elected officials.</p>
      <p>GENERAL REVENUE SHARING</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last year Congress enacted legislation that extends the General Revenue
            Sharing program for three more years. This program is the cornerstone of
            our efforts to maintain the fiscal health of our Nation's local
            government.</span> It will provide $4.6 billion in each of the next three years
         to cities, counties and towns. This program is essential to the
         continued ability of our local governments to provide essential police,
         fire and sanitation services.</p>
      <p>This legislation renewing GRS will be the cornerstone of
         Federal-State-local government relations in the 1980's. <span class="economy">This policy will
            emphasize the need for all levels of government to cooperate in order to
            meet the needs of the most fiscally strained cities and counties, and
            also will emphasize the important role that GRS can play in forging this
            partnership.</span> I am grateful that Congress moved quickly to assure that
         our Nation's localities can begin the 1980's in sound fiscal condition.</p>
      <p>COUNTER-CYCLICAL ASSISTANCE</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last year, I proposed that Congress enact a $1 billion counter-cyclical
            fiscal assistance program to protect States and localities from
            unexpected changes in the national economy.</span> This program unfortunately
         was not enacted by the [full] Congress. I, therefore, have not included
         funding for counter-cyclical aid in my Fiscal Year 1982 budget.
         Nevertheless, I urge Congress to enact a permanent stand-by
         counter-cyclical program, so that States and cities can be protected
         during the next economic downturn.</p>
      <p>URBAN POLICY</p>
      <p>Three years ago, I proposed the Nation's first comprehensive urban
         policy. That policy involved more than one hundred improvements in
         existing Federal programs, four new Executive Orders and nineteen pieces
         of urban-oriented legislation. With Congress' cooperation, sixteen of
         these bills have now been signed into law.</p>
      <p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p>
      <p><span class="economy">One of the principal goals of my domestic policy has been to strengthen
            the private sector economic base of our Nation's economically troubled
            urban and rural areas. With Congress' cooperation, we have substantially
            expanded the Federal government's economic development programs and
            provided new tax incentives for private investment in urban and rural
            communities.</span> These programs have helped many communities to attract new
         private sector jobs and investments and to retain the jobs and
         investments that already are in place.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">When I took office, the Federal government was spending less than $300
            million annually on economic development programs, and only $60 million
            of those funds in our Nation's urban areas.</span> Since that time, we have
         created the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program and
         substantially expanded the economic development programs in the Commerce
         Department. My FY 1982 budget requests more than $1.5 billion for
         economic development grants, loans and interest subsidies and almost
         $1.5 billion for loan guarantees. Approximately 60 percent of these
         funds will be spent in our Nation's urban areas. In addition, we have
         extended the 10 percent investment credit to include rehabilitation of
         existing industrial facilities as well as new construction.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I continue to believe that the development of private sector investment
            and jobs is the key to revitalizing our Nation's economically depressed
            urban and rural areas. </span>To ensure that the necessary economic development
         goes forward, the Congress must continue to provide strong support for
         the UDAG program and the programs for the Economic Development
         Administration. Those programs provide a foundation for the economic
         development of our Nation in the 1980's.</p>
      <p>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</p>
      <p>The partnership among Federal, State and local governments to revitalize
         our Nation's communities has been a high priority of my Administration.
         When I took office, I proposed a substantial expansion of the Community
         Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and the enactment of a new $400
         million Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program. Both of these
         programs have provided essential community and economic development
         assistance to our Nation's cities and counties.</p>
      <p>Last year, Congress reauthorized both the CDBG and UDAG programs. The
         CDBG program was reauthorized for three more years with annual funding
         increases of $150 million, and the UDAG program was extended for three
         years at the current funding level of $675 million annually. My 1982
         budget requests full funding for both of these programs. These actions
         should help our Nation's cities and counties to continue the progress
         they have made in the last three years.</p>
      <p>NEIGHBORHOODS</p>
      <p>During my Administration we have taken numerous positive steps to
         achieve a full partnership of neighborhood organizations and government
         at all levels. <span class="civil-rights">We have successfully fought against red lining and
            housing discrimination.</span> We created innovative Self Help funding and
         technical resource transfer mechanisms. We have created unique methods
         of access for neighborhood organizations to have a participating role in
         Federal and State government decision-making. Neighborhood based
         organizations are the threshold of the American community.</p>
      <p>The Federal government will need to develop more innovative and
         practical ways for neighborhood based organizations to successfully
         participate in the identification and solution of local and neighborhood
         concerns. Full partnership will only be achieved with the knowing
         participation of leaders of government, business, education and unions.
         Neither state nor Federal solutions imposed from on high will suffice.
         Neighborhoods are the fabric and soul of this great land. Neighborhoods
         define the weave that has been used to create a permanent fabric. The
         Federal government must take every opportunity to provide access and
         influence to the individuals and organizations affected at the
         neighborhood level.</p>
      <p>Rural Policy</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of my Administration, I have been committed to
         improving the effectiveness with which the Federal government deals with
         the problems and needs of a rapidly changing rural America. The rapid
         growth of some rural areas has placed a heavy strain on communities and
         their resources. There are also persistent problems of poverty and
         economic stagnation in other parts of rural America. Some rural areas
         continue to lose population, as they have for the past several decades.</p>
      <p>In December, 1979, I announced the Small Community and Rural Development
         Policy. It was the culmination of several years' work and was designed
         to address the varying needs of our rural population. In 1980, my
         Administration worked with the Congress to pass the Rural Development
         Policy Act of 1980, which when fully implemented will allow us to meet
         the needs of rural people and their communities more effectively and
         more efficiently.</p>
      <p>As a result of the policy and the accompanying legislation, we have:</p>
      <p>--Created the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Small
         Community and Rural Development to provide overall leadership.</p>
      <p>--Established a White House Working Group to assist in the
         implementation of the policy.</p>
      <p>--Worked with more than 40 governors to form State rural development
         councils to work in partnership with the White House Working Group, and
         the Federal agencies, to better deliver State and Federal programs to
         rural areas.</p>
      <p>--Directed the White House Working Group to annually review existing and
         proposed policies, programs, and budget levels to determine their
         adequacy in meeting rural needs and the fulfilling of the policy's
         objectives and principles.</p>
      <p>This effort on the part of my Administration and the Congress has
         resulted in a landmark policy. For the first time, rural affairs has
         received the prominence it has always deserved. It is a policy that can
         truly help alleviate the diverse and differing problems rural America
         will face in the 1980's.</p>
      <p>With the help and dedication of a great many people around the country
         who are concerned with rural affairs, we have constructed a mechanism
         for dealing effectively with rural problems. There is now a great
         opportunity to successfully combine Federal efforts with the efforts of
         rural community leaders and residents. It is my hope this spirit of
         cooperation and record of accomplishment will be continued in the coming
         years.</p>
      <p>CONSUMERS</p>
      <p><span class="economy">&gt;In September, 1979, I signed an Executive Order designed to strengthen
            and coordinate Federal consumer programs and to establish procedures to
            improve and facilitate consumer participation in government
            decision-making. Forty Federal agencies have adopted programs to comply
            with the requirements of the Order. </span>These programs will improve
         complaint handling, provide better information to consumers, enhance
         opportunities for public participation in government proceedings, and
         assure that the consumer point of view is considered in all programs,
         policies, and regulations.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">While substantial progress has been made in assuring a consumer presence
            in Federal agencies, work must continue to meet fully the goals of the
            Executive Order. Close monitoring of agency compliance with the
            requirements of the Order is necessary. </span>Continued evaluation to assure
         that the programs are effective and making maximum use of available
         resources is also essential. As a complement to these initiatives,
         efforts to provide financial assistance in regulatory proceedings to
         citizen groups, small businesses, and others whose participation is
         limited by their economic circumstances must continue to be pursued.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="civil-rights">It is essential that consumer representatives in government pay
               particular attention to the needs and interests of low-income consumers
               and minorities.</span></span> The Office of Consumer Affairs' publication, "People
         Power: What Communities Are Doing to Counter Inflation," catalogues some
         of the ways that government and the private sector can assist the less
         powerful in our society to help themselves. New ways should be found to
         help foster this new people's movement which is founded on the principle
         of self-reliance.</p>
      <p>Science and Technology</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Science and technology contribute immeasurably to the lives of all
            Americans. Our high standard of living is largely the product of the
            technology that surrounds us in the home or factory.</span> Our good health is
         due in large part to our ever increasing scientific understanding. Our
         national security is assured by the application pate science and
         technology will bring.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">The Federal government has a special role to play in science and
            technology. Although the fruits of scientific achievements surround us,
            it is often difficult to predict the benefits that will arise from a
            given scientific venture.</span> And these benefits, even if predictable, do
         not usually lead to ownership rights. Accordingly, the Government has a
         special obligation to support science as an investment in our future.</p>
      <p>My Administration has sought to reverse a decade-long decline in
         funding. Despite the need for fiscal restraint, real support of basic
         research has grown nearly 11% during my term in office. And, my
         Administration has sought to increase the support of long-term research
         in the variety of mission agencies. In this way, we can harness the
         American genius for innovation to meet the economic, energy, health, and
         security challenges that confront our nation.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">--International Relations and National Security. Science and technology
               are becoming increasingly important elements of our national security
               and foreign policies. This is especially so in the current age of
               sophisticated defense systems and of growing dependence among all
               countries on modern technology for all aspects of their economic
               strength. </span></span>For these reasons, scientific and technological considerations
         have been integral elements of the Administration's decision-making on
         such national security and foreign policy issues as the modernization of
         our strategic weaponry, arms control, technology transfer, the growing
         bilateral relationship with China, and our relations with the developing
         world.</p>
      <p>Four themes have shaped U.S. policy in international scientific and
         technological cooperation: pursuit of new international initiatives to
         advance our own research and development objectives; development and
         strengthening of scientific exchange to bridge politically ideological,
         and cultural divisions between this country and other countries;
         formulation of programs and institutional relations to help developing
         countries use science and technology beneficially; and cooperation with
         other nations to manage technologies with local impact. At my direction,
         my Science and Technology Adviser has actively pursued international
         programs in support of these four themes. We have given special
         attention to scientific and technical relations with China, to new forms
         of scientific and technical cooperation with Japan, to cooperation with
         Mexico, other Latin American and Caribbean countries and several states
         in Black America, and to the proposed Institute for Scientific and
         Technological Cooperation.</p>
      <p>In particular our cooperation with developing countries reflects the
         importance that each of them has placed on the relationship between
         economic growth and scientific and technological capability. It also
         reflects their view that the great strength of the U.S. in science and
         technology makes close relations with the U.S. technical community an
         especially productive means of enhancing this capability. Scientific and
         technological assistance is a key linkage between the U.S. and the
         developing world, a linkage that has been under-utilized in the past and
         one which we must continue to work to strengthen.</p>
      <p>--Space Policy. The Administration has established a framework for a
         strong and evolving space program for the 1980's.</p>
      <p>The Administration's space policy reaffirmed the separation of military
         space systems and the open civil space program, and at the same time,
         provided new guidance on technology transfer between the civil and
         military programs. The civil space program centers on three basic
         tenets: First, our space policy will reflect a balanced strategy of
         applications, science, and technology development. Second, activities
         will be pursued when they can be uniquely or more efficiently
         accomplished in space. Third, a premature commitment to a high
         challenge, space-engineering initiative of the complexity of Apollo is
         inappropriate. As the Shuttle development phases down, however, there
         will be added flexibility to consider new space applications, space
         science and new space exploration activities.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">--Technology Development. The Shuttle dominates our technology
            development effort and correctly so. It represents one of the most
            sophisticated technological challenges ever undertaken, and as a result,
            has encountered technical problems.</span> Nonetheless, the first manned
         orbital flight is now scheduled for March, 1981. I have been pleased to
         support strongly the necessary funds for the Shuttle throughout my
         Administration.</p>
      <p>--Space Applications. Since 1972, the U.S. has conducted experimental
         civil remote sensing through Landsat satellites, thereby realizing many
         successful applications. Recognizing this fact, I directed the
         implementation of an operational civil land satellite remote sensing
         system, with the operational management responsibility in Commerce's
         National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, because
         ocean observations from space can meet common civil and military data
         requirements, a National Oceanic Satellite System has been proposed as a
         major FY 1981 new start.</p>
      <p>--Space Science Exploration. The goals of this Administration's policy
         in space science have been to: (1) continue a vigorous program of
         planetary exploration to understand the origin and evolution of the
         solar system; (2) utilize the space telescope and free-flying satellites
         to usher in a new era of astronomy; (3) develop a better understanding
         of the sun and its interaction with the terrestrial environment; and (4)
         utilize the Shuttle and Spacelab to conduct basic research that
         complements earth-based life science investigations.</p>
      <p>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</p>
      <p>Washington, D.C., is home to both the Federal Government and to more
         than half a million American citizens. I have worked to improve the
         relationship between the Federal establishment and the Government of the
         District of Columbia in order to further the goals and spirit of home
         rule. The City controls more of its own destiny than was the case four
         years ago. Yet, despite the close cooperation between my Administration
         and that of Mayor Barry, we have not yet seen the necessary number of
         states ratify the Constitutional Amendment granting full voting
         representation in the Congress to the citizens of this city. It is my
         hope that this inequity will be rectified. The country and the people
         who inhabit Washington deserve no less.</p>
      <p>THE ARTS</p>
      <p>The arts are a precious national resource.</p>
      <p>Federal support for the arts has been enhanced during my Administration
         by expanding government funding and services to arts institutions,
         individual artists, scholars, and teachers through the National
         Endowment for the Arts. We have broadened its scope and reach to a more
         diverse population. We have also reactivated the Federal Council on the
         Arts and Humanities.</p>
      <p>It is my hope that during the coming years the new Administration and
         the Congress will:</p>
      <p>--Continue support of institutions promoting development and
         understanding of the arts;</p>
      <p>--Encourage business participants in a comprehensive effort to achieve a
         truly mixed economy of support for the arts;</p>
      <p>--Explore a variety of mechanisms to nurture the creative talent of our
         citizens and build audiences for their work;</p>
      <p>--Support strong, active National Endowments for the Arts;</p>
      <p>--Seek greater recognition for the rich cultural tradition of the
         nation's minorities;</p>
      <p>--Provide grants for the arts in low-income neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>THE HUMANITIES</p>
      <p>In recently reauthorizing Federal appropriations for the National
         Endowment for the Humanities, the Congress has once again reaffirmed
         that "the encouragement and support of national progress and scholarship
         in the humanities . . . while primarily a matter for private and local
         initiative, is also an appropriate matter of concern to the Federal
         Government" and that "a high civilization must not limit its efforts to
         science and technology alone but must give full value and support to the
         other great branches of man's scholarly and cultural activity in order
         to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the
         present, and a better view of the future."</p>
      <p>I believe we are in agreement that the humanities illuminate the values
         underlying important personal, social, and national questions raised in
         our society by its multiple links to and increasing dependence on
         technology, and by the diverse heritage of our many regions and ethnic
         groups. The humanities cast light on the broad issue of the role in a
         society of men and women of imagination and energy--those individuals
         who through their own example define "the spirit of the age," and in so
         doing move nations. Our Government's support for the humanities, within
         the framework laid down by the Congress, is a recognition of their
         essential nourishment of the life of the mind and vital enrichment of
         our national life.</p>
      <p>I will be proposing an increase in funding this year sufficient to
         enable the Endowment to maintain the same level of support offered our
         citizens in Fiscal Year 1981.</p>
      <p>In the allocation of this funding, special emphasis will be given to:</p>
      <p>--Humanities education in the nation's schools, in response to the great
         needs that have arisen in this area;</p>
      <p>--Scholarly research designed to increase our understanding of the
         cultures, traditions, and historical forces at work in other nations and
         in our own;</p>
      <p>--Drawing attention to the physical disintegration of the raw material
         of our cultural heritage--books, manuscripts, periodicals, and other
         documents--and to the development of techniques to prevent the
         destruction and to preserve those materials; and</p>
      <p>--The dissemination of quality programming in the humanities to
         increasingly large American audiences through the use of radio and
         television.</p>
      <p>The dominant effort in the Endowment's expenditures will be a commitment
         to strengthen and promulgate scholarly excellence and achievement in
         work in the humanities in our schools, colleges, universities,
         libraries, museums and other cultural institutions, as well as in the
         work of individual scholars or collaborative groups engaged in advanced
         research in the humanities.</p>
      <p>In making its grants the Endowment will increase its emphasis on
         techniques which stimulate support for the humanities from non-Federal
         sources, in order to reinforce our tradition of private philanthropy in
         this field, and to insure and expand the financial viability of our
         cultural institutions and life.</p>
      <p>INSULAR AREAS</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I have been firmly committed to self-determination for Puerto Rico, the
            Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands,
            and have vigorously supported the realization of whatever political
            status aspirations are democratically chosen by their peoples. This
            principle was the keystone of the comprehensive territorial policy I
            sent the Congress last year.</span> I am pleased that most of the legislative
         elements of that policy were endorsed by the 96th Congress.</p>
      <p>The unique cultures, fragile economies, and locations of our Caribbean
         and Pacific Islands are distinct assets to the United States which
         require the sensitive application of policy. The United States
         Government should pursue initiatives begun by my Administration and the
         Congress to stimulate insular economic development; enhance treatment
         under Federal programs eliminating current inequities; provide vitally
         needed special assistance and coordinate and rationalize policies. These
         measures will result in greater self-sufficiency and balanced growth. In
         particular, I hope that the new Congress will support funding for fiscal
         management, comprehensive planning and other technical assistance for
         the territories, as well as create the commission I have proposed to
         review the applicability of all Federal laws to the insular areas and
         make recommendations for appropriate modification.</p>
      <p>IV. REMOVING GOVERNMENTAL WASTE AND INEFFICIENCY</p>
      <p>One of my major commitments has been to restore public faith in our
         Federal government by cutting out waste and inefficiency. In the past
         four years, we have made dramatic advances toward this goal, many of
         them previously considered impossible to achieve. Where government rules
         and operations were unnecessary, they have been eliminated, as with
         airline, rail, trucking and financial deregulation. Where government
         functions are needed, they have been streamlined, through such landmark
         measures as the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. I hope that the new
         administration and the Congress will keep up the momentum we have
         established for effective and responsible change in this area of crucial
         public concern.</p>
      <p>CIVIL SERVICE REFORM</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">In March 1978, I submitted the Civil Service Reform Act to Congress. I
            called it the centerpiece of my efforts to reform and reorganize the
            government. With bipartisan support from Congress, the bill passed, and
            I am pleased to say that implementation is running well ahead of the
            statutory schedule</span>. Throughout the service, we are putting into place
         the means to assure that reward and retention are based on performance
         and not simply on length of time on the job. In the first real test of
         the Reform Act, 98 percent of the eligible top-level managers joined the
         Senior Executive Service, choosing to relinquish job protections for the
         challenge and potential reward of this new corps of top executives.
         Though the Act does not require several of its key elements to be in
         operation for another year, some Federal agencies already have
         established merit pay systems for GS-13-15 managers, and most agencies
         are well on their way to establishing new performance standards for all
         their employees. All have paid out, or are now in the process of paying
         out, performance bonuses earned by outstanding members of the Senior
         Executive Service. Dismissals have increased by 10 percent, and
         dismissals specifically for inadequate job performance have risen 1500
         percent, since the Act was adopted. Finally, we have established a fully
         independent Merit Systems Protection Board and Special Counsel to
         protect the rights of whistle-blowers and other Federal employees faced
         with threats to their rights.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">In 1981, civil service reform faces critical challenges, all agencies
            must have fully functioning performance appraisal systems for all
            employees, and merit pay systems for compensating the government's
            130,000 GS-13-15 managers. Performance bonuses for members of the Senior
            Executive Service will surely receive scrutiny. If this attention is
            balanced and constructive, it can only enhance the chances for ultimate
            success of our bipartisan commitment to the revolutionary and crucial
            "pay for performance" concept.</span></p>
      <p>REGULATORY REFORM</p>
      <p>During the past four years we have made tremendous progress in
         regulatory reform. We have discarded old economic regulations that
         prevented competition and raised consumer costs, and we have imposed
         strong management principles on the regulatory programs the country
         needs, cutting paperwork and other wasteful burdens. The challenge for
         the future is to continue the progress in both areas without crippling
         vital health and safety programs.</p>
      <p>Our economic deregulation program has achieved major successes in five
         areas:</p>
      <p>Airlines: The Airline Deregulation Act is generating healthy
         competition, saving billions in fares, and making the airlines more
         efficient. The Act provides that in 1985 the CAB itself will go out of
         existence.</p>
      <p>Trucking: The trucking deregulation bill opens the industry to
         competition and allows truckers wide latitude on the routes they drive
         and the goods they haul. The bill also phases out most of the old law's
         immunity for setting rates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates
         these reforms will save as much as $8 billion per year and cut as much
         as half a percentage point from the inflation rate.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Railroads: Overregulation has stifled railroad management initiative,
            service, and competitive pricing. The new legislation gives the
            railroads the freedom they need to rebuild a strong, efficient railroad
            industry.</span></p>
      <p>Financial Institutions: With the help of the Congress, over the past
         four years we have achieved two major pieces of financial reform
         legislation, legislation which has provided the basis for the most
         far-reaching changes in the financial services industry since the
         1930's. The International Banking Act of 1978 was designed to reduce the
         advantages that foreign banks operating in the United States possessed
         in comparison to domestic banks. The Depository Institutions
         Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, adopted last March, provides for
         the phased elimination of a variety of anti-competitive barriers to
         financial institutions and freedom to offer services to and attract the
         savings of consumers, especially small savers.</p>
      <p>Recently, I submitted to the Congress my Administration's
         recommendations for the phased liberalization of restrictions on
         geographic expansion by commercial banks. Last year the Administration
         and financial regulatory agencies proposed legislation to permit the
         interstate acquisition of failing depository institutions. In view of
         the difficult outlook for some depository institutions I strongly urge
         the Congress to take prompt favorable action on the failing bank
         legislation.</p>
      <p>Telecommunications: While Congress did not pass legislation in this
         area, the Federal Communications Commission has taken dramatic action to
         open all aspects of communications to competition and to eliminate
         regulations in the areas where competition made them obsolete. The
         public is benefitting from an explosion of competition and new services.</p>
      <p>While these initiatives represent dramatic progress in economic
         deregulation, continued work is needed. I urge Congress to act on
         communications legislation and to consider other proposed deregulation
         measures, such as legislation on the bus industry. In addition, the
         regulatory commissions must maintain their commitment to competition as
         the best regulator of all.</p>
      <p>The other part of my reform program covers the regulations that are
         needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens. For
         these regulations, my Administration has created a management program to
         cut costs without sacrificing goals. Under my Executive Order 12044, we
         required agencies to analyze the costs of their major new rules and
         consider alternative approaches, such as performance standards and
         voluntary codes, that may make rules less costly and more flexible. We
         created the Regulatory Analysis Review Group in the White House to
         analyze the most costly proposed new rules and find ways to improve
         them. The Regulatory Council was established to provide the first
         Government-wide listing of upcoming rules and eliminate overlapping and
         conflicting regulations. Agencies have launched "sunset" programs to
         weed out outmoded old regulations. We have acted to encourage public
         participation in regulatory decision-making.</p>
      <p>These steps have already saved billions of dollars in regulatory costs
         and slashed thousands of outmoded regulations. We are moving steadily
         toward a regulatory system that provides needed protections fairly,
         predictably, and at minimum cost.</p>
      <p>I urge Congress to continue on this steady path and resist the
         simplistic solutions that have been proposed as alternatives. Proposals
         like legislative veto and increased judicial review will add another
         layer to the regulatory process, making it more cumbersome and
         inefficient. The right approach to reform is to improve the individual
         statutes, where they need change, and to ensure that the regulatory
         agencies implement those statutes sensibly.</p>
      <p>PAPERWORK REDUCTION</p>
      <p>The Federal Government imposes a huge paperwork burden on business,
         local government, and the private sector. Many of these forms are needed
         for vital government functions, but others are duplicative, overly
         complex or obsolete.</p>
      <p>During my Administration we cut the paperwork burden by 15 percent, and
         we created procedures to continue this progress. The new Paperwork
         Reduction Act centralizes, in OMB, oversight of all agencies'
         information requirements and strengthens OMB's authority to eliminate
         needless forms. The "paperwork budget" process, which I established by
         executive order, applies the discipline of the budget process to the
         hours of reporting time imposed on the public, forcing agencies to
         scrutinize all their forms each year. With effective implementation,
         these steps should allow further, substantial paperwork cuts in the
         years ahead.</p>
      <p>TIGHTENING STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND INTEGRITY</p>
      <p>To develop a foundation to carry out energy policy, we consolidated
         scattered energy programs and launched the Synthetic Fuels Corporation;
         to give education the priority it deserves and at the same time reduce
         HHS to more manageable size, I gave education a seat at the Cabinet
         table, to create a stronger system for attacking waste and fraud, I
         reorganized audit and investigative functions by putting an Inspector
         General in major agencies. Since I took office, we have submitted 14
         reorganization initiatives and had them all approved by Congress. We
         have saved hundreds of millions of dollars through the adoption of
         businesslike cash management principles and set strict standards for
         personal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by high
         Federal officials.</p>
      <p>To streamline the structure of the government, we have secured approval
         of 14 reorganization initiatives, improving the efficiency of the most
         important sectors of the government, including energy, education, and
         civil rights enforcement. We have eliminated more than 300 advisory
         committees as well as other agencies, boards and commissions which were
         obsolete or ineffective. Independent Inspectors General have been
         appointed in major agencies to attack fraud and waste. More than a
         billion dollars of questionable transactions have been identified
         through their audit activities.</p>
      <p>The adoption of business-like cash management and debt collection
         initiatives will save over $1 billion, by streamlining the processing of
         receipts, by controlling disbursements more carefully, and by reducing
         idle cash balances. Finally this Administration has set strict standards
         for personal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by
         high Federal officials, to elevate the level of public trust in the
         government.</p>
      <p>V. PROTECTING BASIC RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I am extremely proud of the advances we have made in ensuring equality
            and protecting the basic freedoms of all Americans.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of
            Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) have been reorganized and
            strengthened and a permanent civil rights unit has been established in
            OMB.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">--To avoid fragmented, inconsistent and duplicative enforcement of civil
            rights laws, three agencies have been given coordinative and
            standard-setting responsibilities in discrete areas: EEOC for all
            employment-related activities, HUD for all those relating to housing,
            and the Department of Justice for all other areas.</span></p>
      <p>--With the enactment of the Right to Financial Privacy Act and a bill
         limiting police search of newsrooms, we have begun to establish a sound,
         comprehensive, privacy program.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment must be aggressively pursued.
            Only one year remains in which to obtain ratification by three
            additional states.</span></p>
      <p>The Congress must give early attention to a number of important bills
         which remain. These bills would:</p>
      <p>--strengthen the laws against discrimination in housing. Until it is
         enacted, the 1968 Civil Rights Act's promise of equal access to housing
         will remain unfulfilled;</p>
      <p>--establish a charter for the FBI and the intelligence agencies. The
         failure to define in law the duties and responsibilities of these
         agencies has made possible some of the abuses which have occurred in
         recent years;</p>
      <p>--establish privacy safeguards for medical research, bank, insurance,
         and credit records; and provide special protection for election fund
         transfer systems.</p>
      <p>EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I remain committed as strongly as possible to the ratification of the
            Equal Rights Amendment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">As a result of our efforts in 1978, the Equal Rights Amendment's
            deadline for ratification was extended for three years. We have now one
            year and three States left. We cannot afford any delay in marshalling
            our resources and efforts to obtain the ratification of those three
            additional States.</span></p>
      <p>Although the Congress has no official role in the ratification process
         at this point, you do have the ability to affect public opinion and the
         support of State Legislators for the Amendment. I urge Members from
         States which have not yet ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to use
         their influence to secure ratification. I will continue my own efforts
         to help ensure ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.</p>
      <p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led this Nation's effort to provide all its
            citizens with civil rights and equal opportunities. His commitment to
            human rights, peace and non-violence stands as a monument to his
            humanity and courage. As one of our Nation's most outstanding leaders,
            it is appropriate that his birthday be commemorated as a national
            holiday.</span> I hope the Congress will enact legislation this year that will
         achieve this goal.</p>
      <p>FAIR HOUSING</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1980 passed the House of
            Representatives by an overwhelming bipartisan majority only to die in
            the Senate at the close of the 96th Congress. The leaders of both
            parties have pledged to make the enactment of fair housing legislation a
            top priority of the incoming Congress.</span> The need is pressing and a
         strengthened federal enforcement effort must be the primary method of
         resolution.</p>
      <p>CRIMINAL CODE</p>
      <p>The Federal criminal laws are often archaic, frequently contradictory
         and imprecise, and clearly in need of revision and codification. The new
         Administration should continue the work which has been begun to develop
         a Federal criminal code which simplifies and clarifies our criminal
         laws, while maintaining our basic civil liberties and protections.</p>
      <p>PRIVACY</p>
      <p>As our public and private institutions collect more and more information
         and as communications and computer technologies advance, we must act to
         protect the personal privacy of our citizens.</p>
      <p>In the past four years we acted on the report of the Privacy Commission
         and established a national privacy policy. We worked with Congress to
         pass legislation restricting wiretaps and law enforcement access to bank
         records and to reporters' files. We reduced the number of personal files
         held by the government and restricted the transfer of personal
         information among Federal agencies. We also worked with the Organization
         for Economic Cooperation and Development to establish international
         guidelines to protect the privacy of personal information that is
         transferred across borders.</p>
      <p>VI. PROTECTING AND DEVELOPING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES</p>
      <p>Two of our Nation's most precious natural resources are our environment
         and our vast agricultural capacity. From the beginning of my
         Administration, I have worked with the Congress to enhance and protect,
         as well as develop our natural resources. In the environmental areas, I
         have been especially concerned about the importance of balancing the
         need for resource development with preserving a clean environment, and
         have taken numerous actions to foster this goal. In the agricultural
         area, I have taken the steps needed to improve farm incomes and to
         increase our agricultural production to record levels. That progress
         must be continued in the 1980's.</p>
      <p>ENVIRONMENT</p>
      <p>Preserving the quality of our environment has been among the most
         important objectives of my Administration and of the Congress. As a
         result of these shared commitments and the dedicated efforts of many
         members of the Congress and my Administration, we have achieved several
         historic accomplishments.</p>
      <p>PROTECTION OF ALASKA LANDS</p>
      <p>Passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act was one
         of the most important conservation actions of this century. At stake was
         the fate of millions of acres of beautiful land, outstanding and unique
         wildlife populations, native cultures, and the opportunity to ensure
         that future generations of Americans would be able to enjoy the benefits
         of these nationally significant resources. As a result of the
         leadership, commitment, and persistence of my Administration and the
         Congressional leadership, the Alaska Lands Bill was signed into law last
         December.</p>
      <p>The Act adds 97 million acres of new parks and refuges, more than
         doubling the size of our National Park and National Wildlife Refuge
         Systems. The bill triples the size of our national wilderness system,
         increasing its size by 56 million acres. And by adding 25 free-flowing
         river segments to the Wild and Scenic River System, the bill almost
         doubles the river mileage in that system. The Alaska Lands Act reaffirms
         our commitment to the environment and strikes a balance between
         protecting areas of great beauty and allowing development of Alaska's
         oil, gas, mineral, and timber resources.</p>
      <p>PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES</p>
      <p>In addition to the Alaska Lands Act, over the past four years we have
         been able to expand significantly the national wilderness and parks
         systems. In 1978, the Congress passed the historical Omnibus Parks Act,
         which made 12 additions to the National Park System. The Act also
         established the first two national trails since the National Trails
         System Act was passed in 1968. Then, in 1980, as a result of my 1979
         Environmental Message, the Federal land management agencies have
         established almost 300 new National Recreational Trails. With the
         completion of the RARE II process, which eliminated the uncertainty
         surrounding the status of millions of acres of land, we called for over
         15 million acres of new wilderness in the nation's National Forest, in
         1980 the Congress established about 4.5 million acres of wilderness in
         the lower 48 states. In addition, the Administration recommended
         legislation to protect Lake Tahoe, and through an Executive Order has
         already established a mechanism to help ensure the Lake's protection.
         Finally, in 1980 the Administration established the Channel Islands
         Marine Sanctuary.</p>
      <p>Administration actions over the past four years stressed the importance
         of providing Federal support only for water resource projects that are
         economically and environmentally sound. This policy should have a major
         and lasting influence on the federal government's role in water resource
         development and management. The Administration's actions to recommend to
         the Congress only economically and environmentally sound water resource
         projects for funding resulted not only in our opposing uneconomic
         projects but also, in 1979, in the first Administration proposal of new
         project starts in 4 years.</p>
      <p>One of the most significant water policy actions of the past four years
         was the Administration's June 6, 1978 Water Policy Reform Message to the
         Congress. This Message established a new national water resources policy
         with the following objectives:</p>
      <p>--to give priority emphasis to water conservation;</p>
      <p>--to consider environmental requirements and values more fully and along
         with economic factors in the planning and management of water projects
         and programs;</p>
      <p>--to enhance cooperation between state and federal agencies in water
         resources planning and management.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Executive Office of the President established 11 policy
         decision criteria to evaluate the proposed federal water projects, the
         Water Resources Council developed and adopted a new set of Principles
         and Standards for water projects which is binding on all federal
         construction agencies, and improved regulations were developed to
         implement the National Historic Preservation Act and the Fish and
         Wildlife Coordination Act. As a result, water resource projects must be
         determined to be economically sound before the Administration will
         recommend authorization or appropriation. Over the years ahead, this
         policy will help to reduce wasteful federal spending by targeting
         federal funds to the highest priority water resource projects.</p>
      <p>In the pursuit of this policy, however, we cannot lose projects. In the
         part that sound water resource projects play in providing irrigation,
         power, and flood control. We must also recognize the special needs of
         particular regions of the country in evaluating the need for additional
         projects.</p>
      <p>ADDRESSING GLOBAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS</p>
      <p>The Global 2000 Report to the President, prepared in response to my 1977
         Environment Message, is the first of its kind. Never before has our
         government, or any government, taken such a comprehensive, long-range
         look at the interrelated global issues of resources, population, and
         environment.</p>
      <p>The Report's conclusions are important. They point to a rapid increase
         in population and human needs through the year 2000 while at the same
         time a decline in the earth's capacity to meet those needs, unless
         nations of the world act decisively to alter current trends.</p>
      <p>The United States has contributed actively to a series of U.N.
         conferences on the environment, population, and resources, and is
         preparing for the 1981 Conference on New and Renewable Sources of
         Energy. Following my 1977 Environmental Message, the Administration
         development assistance programs have added emphasis to natural resource
         management and environmental protection. My 1979 Environmental Message
         called attention to the alarming loss of world forests, particularly in
         the tropics. An interagency task force on tropical forests has developed
         a U.S. government program to encourage conservation and wise management
         of tropical forests. The Administration is encouraging action by other
         nations and world organizations to the same purpose. The United States
         is a world leader in wildlife conservation and the assessment of
         environmental effects of government actions. The January 5, 1979,
         Executive Order directing U.S. government agencies to consider the
         effects of their major actions abroad, is another example of this
         leadership.</p>
      <p>COMMITMENT TO CONTROL OF POLLUTION AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS</p>
      <p>Over the past four years, there has been steady progress towards cleaner
         air and water, sustained by the commitment of Congress and the
         Administration to these important national objectives. In addition, the
         Administration has developed several new pollution compliance approaches
         such as alternative and innovative waste water treatment projects, the
         "bubble" concept, the "offset" policy, and permit consolidation, all of
         which are designed to reduce regulatory burdens on the private sector.</p>
      <p>One of the most pressing problems to come to light in the past four
         years has been improper hazardous waste disposal. The Administration has
         moved on three fronts. First, we proposed the Oil Hazardous Substances
         and Hazardous Waste Response, Liability and Compensation Act (the
         Superfund bill) to provide comprehensive authority and $1.6 billion in
         funds to clean up abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites. In November
         1980 the Congress passed a Superfund bill which I signed into law.</p>
      <p>Second, the administration established a hazardous waste enforcement
         strike force to ensure that when available, responsible parties are
         required to clean up sites posing dangers to public health and to the
         environment. To date, 50 lawsuits have been brought by the strike force.</p>
      <p>Third, regulations implementing subtitle C of the Resource Conservation
         and Recovery Act were issued. The regulations establish comprehensive
         controls for hazardous waste and, together with vigorous enforcement,
         will help to ensure that Love Canal will not be repeated.</p>
      <p>THE FUTURE</p>
      <p>For the future, we cannot, and we must not, forget that we are charged
         with the stewardship of an irreplaceable environment and natural
         heritage. Our children, and our children's children, are dependent upon
         our maintaining our commitment to preserving and enhancing the quality
         of our environment. It is my hope that when our descendants look back on
         the 1980's they will be able to affirm:</p>
      <p>--that we kept our commitment to the restoration of environmental
         quality;</p>
      <p>--that we protected the public health from the continuing dangers of
         toxic chemicals, from pollution, from hazardous and radioactive waste,
         and that we made our communities safer, healthier and better places to
         live;</p>
      <p>--that we preserved America's wilderness areas and particularly its last
         great frontier, Alaska, for the benefit of all Americans in perpetuity;</p>
      <p>--that we put this nation on a path to a sustainable energy future, one
         based increasingly on renewable resources and on energy conservation;</p>
      <p>--that we moved to protect America's countryside and coastland from
         mismanagement and irresponsibility;</p>
      <p>--that we redirected the management of the nation's water resources
         toward water conservation, sound development and environmental
         protection;</p>
      <p>--that we faced squarely such worldwide problems as the destruction of
         forests, acid rain, carbon dioxide build-up and nuclear proliferation;
         and</p>
      <p>--that we protected the habitat and the existence of our own species on
         this earth.</p>
      <p>AGRICULTURE THE FARM ECONOMY</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The farm economy is sound and its future is bright. Agriculture remains
            a major bulwark of the nation's economy and an even more important
            factor in the world food system.</span> The demand for America's agricultural
         abundance, here and abroad, continues to grow. In the near-term, the
         strength of this demand is expected to press hard against supplies,
         resulting in continued price strength.</p>
      <p>The health and vitality of current-day agriculture represents a
         significant departure from the situation that existed when I came to
         office four years ago. <span class="economy">In January 1977, the farm economy was in serious
            trouble. Farm prices and farm income were falling rapidly. Grain prices
            were at their lowest levels in years and steadily falling.</span> Livestock
         producers, in their fourth straight year of record losses, were
         liquidating breeding herds at an unparalleled rate. Dairy farmers were
         losing money on every hundredweight of milk they produced. Sugar prices
         were in a nosedive.</p>
      <p>Through a combination of improvements in old, established programs and
         the adoption of new approaches where innovation and change were needed,
         my Administration turned this situation around. Commodity prices have
         steadily risen. Farm income turned upward. U.S. farm exports set new
         records each year, increasing over 80 percent for the four year period.
         Livestock producers began rebuilding their herds. Dairy farmers began to
         earn a profit again.</p>
      <p>RECENT POLICY INITIATIVES</p>
      <p>Several major agricultural policy initiatives have been undertaken over
         the past year. Some are the culmination of policy proposals made earlier
         in this Administration; others are measures taken to help farmers offset
         the impact of rapid inflation in production costs. In combination, they
         represent a significant strengthening of our nation's food and
         agricultural policy. These initiatives include:</p>
      <p>FOOD SECURITY RESERVE</p>
      <p>The Congress authorized formation of a 4 million ton food grain reserve
         for use in international food assistance. This reserve makes it possible
         for the United States to stand behind its food aid commitment to food
         deficit nations, even during periods of short supplies and high prices.
         This corrects a serious fault in our past food assistance policy.</p>
      <p>COMPREHENSIVE CROP INSURANCE</p>
      <p>The Congress also authorized a significant new crop insurance program
         during 1980. This measure provides farmers with an important new program
         tool for sharing the economic risks that are inherent to agriculture.
         When fully operational, it will replace a hodgepodge of disaster
         programs that suffered from numerous shortcomings.</p>
      <p>SPECIAL LOAN RATES</p>
      <p>Another legislative measure passed late in the 2nd session of the 96th
         Congress authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide higher loan
         rates to farmers who enter their grain in the farmer-owned grain
         reserve. This additional incentive to participate will further
         strengthen the reserve.</p>
      <p>INCREASED LOAN PRICES</p>
      <p>In July 1980, I administratively raised loan prices for wheat,
         feedgrains, and soybeans to help offset the effects of a serious
         cost-price squeeze. At the same time, the release and call prices for
         the grain reserve were adjusted upward.</p>
      <p>HIGHER TARGET PRICES</p>
      <p>The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1980 raised the target prices for
         1980-crop wheat and feed grain crops. This change corrected for
         shortcomings in the adjustment formula contained in the Food and
         Agriculture Act of 1977.</p>
      <p>FUTURE AGENDA</p>
      <p>The food and agricultural policies adopted by this Administration over
         the past four years, including those described above, will provide a
         firm foundation for future governmental actions in this field.
         Expiration of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 later this year will
         require early attention by the Congress. With relatively minor changes,
         most of the authorities contained in the 1977 Act should be extended in
         their present form. The farmer-owned grain reserve has proven to be a
         particularly effective means of stabilizing grain markets and should be
         preserved in essentially its present form.</p>
      <p>Beyond this, it will be important for the Congress to keep a close eye
         on price-cost developments in the farm sector. As noted above, some of
         the actions I took last year were for the purpose of providing relief
         from the cost-price squeeze facing farmers. Should these pressures
         continue, further actions might be required.</p>
      <p>My Administration has devoted particular attention to the issues of
         world hunger, agricultural land use, and the future structure of
         American agriculture. I encourage the Congress and the next
         Administration to review the results of these landmark enquiries and,
         where deemed appropriate, to act on their recommendations.</p>
      <p>Following a careful review of the situation, I recently extended the
         suspension of grain sales to the Soviet Union. I am satisfied that this
         action has served its purpose effectively and fairly. However, as long
         as this suspension must remain in effect, it will be important for the
         next Administration and the Congress to take whatever actions are
         necessary to ensure that the burden does not fall unfairly on our
         Nation's farmers. This has been a key feature of my Administration's
         policy, and it should be maintained.</p>
      <p>VII. FOREIGN POLICY</p>
      <p>From the time I assumed office four years ago this month, I have
         stressed the need for this country to assert a leading role in a world
         undergoing the most extensive and intensive change in human history.</p>
      <p>My policies have been directed in particular at three areas of change:</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the steady growth and increased projection abroad of Soviet military
            power, power that has grown faster than our own over the past two
            decades.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--the overwhelming dependence of Western nations, which now increasingly
            includes the United States, on vital oil supplies from the Middle East.</span></p>
      <p>--the pressures of change in many nations of the developing world, in
         Iran and uncertainty about the future stability of many developing
         countries.</p>
      <p>As a result of those fundamental facts, we face some of the most serious
         challenges in the history of this nation. <span class="war">The Soviet invasion of
            Afghanistan is a threat to global peace, to East-West relations, and to
            regional stable flow of oil.</span> As the unprecedented relations, an and
         overwhelming vote in the General Assembly demonstrated, countries across
         the world, and particularly the nonaligned, regard the Soviet invasion
         as a threat to their independence and security. Turmoil within the
         region adjacent to the Persian Gulf poses risks for the security and
         prosperity of every oil importing nation and thus for the entire global
         economy. The continuing holding of American hostages in Iran is both an
         affront to civilized people everywhere, and a serious impediment to
         meeting the self-evident threat to widely-shared common interests,
         including those of Iran.</p>
      <p>But as we focus our most urgent efforts on pressing problems, we will
         continue to pursue the benefits that only change can bring. For it
         always has been the essence of America that we want to move on, we
         understand that prosperity, progress and most of all peace cannot be had
         by standing still. A world of nations striving to preserve their
         independence, and of peoples aspiring for economic development and
         political freedom, is not a world hostile to the ideals and interests of
         the United States. We face powerful adversaries, but we have strong
         friends and dependable allies. We have common interests with the vast
         majority of the world's nations and peoples.</p>
      <p>There have been encouraging developments in recent years, as well as
         matters requiring continued vigilance and concern:</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--Our alliances with the world's most advanced and democratic states
            from Western Europe through Japan are stronger than ever.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--We have helped to bring about a dramatic improvement in relations
            between Egypt and Israel and an historic step towards a comprehensive
            Arab-Israeli settlement.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--Our relations with China are growing closer, providing a major new
            dimension in our policy in Asia and the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--Across southern Africa from Rhodesia to Namibia we are helping with
            the peaceful transition to majority rule in a context of respect for
            minority as well as majority rights.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--We have worked domestically and with our allies to respond to an
            uncertain energy situation by conservation and diversification of energy
            supplies based on internationally agreed targets.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--We have unambiguously demonstrated our commitment to defend Western
            interests in Southwest Asia, and we have significantly increased our
            ability to do so.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">--And over the past four years the U.S. has developed an energy program
            which is comprehensive and ambitious. New institutions have been
            established such as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and Solar Bank.
            Price decontrol for oil and gas is proceeding. </span>American consumers have
         risen to the challenge, and we have experienced real improvements in
         consumption patterns.</p>
      <p>The central challenge for us today is to our steadfastedness of purpose.
         We are no longer tempted by isolationism. But we must also learn to deal
         effectively with the contradictions of the world, the need to cooperate
         with potential adversaries without euphoria, without undermining our
         determination to compete with such adversaries and if necessary confront
         the threats they may pose to our security.</p>
      <p>We face a broad range of threats and opportunities. We have and should
         continue to pursue a broad range of defense, diplomatic and economic
         capabilities and objectives.</p>
      <p>I see six basic goals for America in the world over the 1980's:</p>
      <p><span class="war">--First, we will continue, as we have over the past four years, to build
            America's military strength and that of our allies and friends. Neither
            the Soviet Union nor any other nation will have reason to question our
            will to sustain the strongest and most flexible defense forces.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">--Second, we will pursue an active diplomacy in the world, working,
            together with our friends and allies, to resolve disputes through
            peaceful means and to make any aggressor pay a heavy price.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">--Third, we will strive to resolve pressing international economic
               problems, particularly energy and inflation, and continue to pursue our
               still larger objective of global economic growth through expanded trade
               and development assistance and through the preservation of an open
               multilateral trading system.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">--Fourth, we will continue vigorously to support the process of building
            democratic institutions and improving human rights protection around the
            world.</span> We are deeply convinced that the future lies not with
         dictatorship but democracy.</p>
      <p><span class="war">--Fifth, we remain deeply committed to the process of mutual and
            verifiable arms control, particularly to the effort to prevent the
            spread and further development of nuclear weapons.</span> Our decision to
         defer, but not abandon our efforts to secure ratification of the SALT II
         Treaty reflects our firm conviction that the United States has a
         profound national security interest in the constraints on Soviet nuclear
         forces which only that treaty can provide.</p>
      <p>--Sixth, we must continue to look ahead in order to evaluate and respond
         to resource, environment and population challenges through the end of
         this century.</p>
      <p>One very immediate and pressing objective that is uppermost on our minds
         and those of the American people is the release of our hostages in Iran.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We have no basic quarrel with the nation, the revolution or the people
            of Iran. The threat to them comes not from American policy but from
            Soviet actions in the region.</span> We are prepared to work with the
         government of Iran to develop a new and mutually beneficial
         relationship.</p>
      <p>But that will not be possible so long as Iran continues to hold
         Americans hostages, in defiance of the world community and civilized
         behavior. They must be released unharmed. We have thus far pursued a
         measured program of peaceful diplomatic and economic steps in an attempt
         to resolve this issue without resorting to other remedies available to
         us under international law. This reflects the deep respect of our nation
         for the rule of law and for the safety of our people being held, and our
         belief that a great power bears a responsibility to use its strength in
         a measured and judicious manner. But our patience is not unlimited and
         our concern for the well-being of our fellow citizens grows each day.</p>
      <p>ENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICAN MILITARY STRENGTH</p>
      <p><span class="war">The maintenance of national security is my first concern, as it has been
            for every president before me.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We must have both the military power and the political will to deter our
            adversaries and to support our friends and allies.</span></p>
      <p>We must pay whatever price is required to remain the strongest nation in
         the world. <span class="war">That price has increased as the military power of our major
            adversary has grown and its readiness to use that power been made all
            too evident in Afghanistan.</span> The real increases in defense spending,
         therefore probably will be higher than previously projected; protecting
         our security may require a larger share of our national wealth in the
         future.</p>
      <p>THE U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONSHIP</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are demonstrating to the Soviet Union across a broad front that it
            will pay a heavy price for its aggression in terms of our relationship.
            Throughout the last decades U.S.-Soviet relations have been a mixture of
            cooperation and competition.</span> The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the
         imposition of a puppet government have highlighted in the starkest terms
         the darker side of their policies, going well beyond competition and the
         legitimate pursuit of national interest, and violating all norms of
         international law and practice.</p>
      <p>This attempt to subjugate an independent, non-aligned Islamic people is
         a callous violation of international law and the United Nations Charter,
         two fundamentals of international order. Hence, it is also a dangerous
         threat to world peace. <span class="war">For the first time since the communization of
            Eastern Europe after World War II, the Soviets have sent combat forces
            into an area that was not previously under their control, into a
            non-aligned and sovereign state.</span></p>
      <p>The destruction of the independence of the Afghanistan government and
         the occupation by the Soviet Union have altered the strategic situation
         in that part of the world in a very ominous fashion. It has
         significantly shortened the striking distance to the Indian Ocean and
         the Persian Gulf for the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>It has also eliminated a buffer between the Soviet Union and Pakistan
         and presented a new threat to Iran. These two countries are now far more
         vulnerable to Soviet political intimidation. If that intimidation were
         to prove effective, the Soviet Union could control an area of vital
         strategic and economic significance to the survival of Western Europe,
         the Far East, and ultimately the United States.</p>
      <p><span class="war">It has now been over a year since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
            dealt a major blow to U.S.-Soviet relations and the entire international
            system. The U.S. response has proven to be serious and far-reaching. It
            has been increasingly effective, imposing real and sustained costs on
            the U.S.S.R.'s economy and international image.</span></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we have encouraged and supported efforts to reach a political
         settlement in Afghanistan which would lead to a withdrawal of Soviet
         forces from that country and meet the interests of all concerned. It is
         Soviet intransigence that has kept those efforts from bearing fruit.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, an overwhelming November resolution of the United Nations
         General Assembly on Afghanistan has again made clear that the world has
         not and will not forget Afghanistan. And our response continues to make
         it clear that Soviet use of force in pursuit of its international
         objectives is incompatible with the notion of business-as-usual.</p>
      <p>BILATERAL COMMUNICATION</p>
      <p><span class="war">U.S.-Soviet relations remain strained by the continued Soviet presence
            in Afghanistan, by growing Soviet military capabilities, and by the
            Soviets' apparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect
            for the most basic norms of international behavior.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">But the U.S.-Soviet relationship remains the single most important
               element in determining whether there will be war or peace. And so,
               despite serious strains in our relations, we have maintained a dialogue
               with the Soviet Union over the past year. Through this dialogue, we have
               ensured against bilateral misunderstandings and miscalculations which
               might escalate out of control, and have managed to avoid the injection
               of superpower rivalries into areas of tension like the Iran-Iraq
               conflict.</span></span></p>
      <p>POLAND</p>
      <p><span class="war">Now, as was the case a year ago, the prospect of Soviet use of force
            threatens the international order. The Soviet Union has completed
            preparations for a possible military intervention against Poland.
            Although the situation in Poland has shown signs of stabilizing
            recently, Soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness and they
            could move into Poland on short notice.</span> We continue to believe that the
         Polish people should be allowed to work out their internal problems
         themselves, without outside interference, and we have made clear to the
         Soviet leadership that any intervention in Poland would have severe and
         prolonged consequences for East-West detente, and U.S.-Soviet relations
         in particular.</p>
      <p>DEFENSE BUDGET</p>
      <p><span class="war">For many years the Soviets have steadily increased their real defense
            spending, expanded their strategic forces, strengthened their forces in
            Europe and Asia, and enhanced their capability for projecting military
            force around the world directly or through the use of proxies.</span>
         Afghanistan dramatizes the vastly increased military power of the Soviet
         Union.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The Soviet Union has built a war machine far beyond any reasonable
            requirements for their own defense and security.</span> In contrast, our own
         defense spending declined in real terms every year from 1968 through
         1976.</p>
      <p>We have reversed this decline in our own effort. Every year since 1976
         there has been a real increase in our defense spending, and our lead has
         encouraged increases by our allies. With the support of the Congress, we
         must and will make an even greater effort in the years ahead.</p>
      <p>T<span class="war"><span class="economy">he Fiscal Year 1982 budget would increase funding authority for defense
               to more than $196 billion. This amount, together with a supplemental
               request for FY 1981 of about $6 billion, will more than meet my
               Administration's pledge for a sustained growth of 3 percent in real
               expenditures, and provides for 5 percent in program growth in FY 1982
               and beyond.</span></span></p>
      <p>The trends we mean to correct cannot be remedied overnight; we must be
         willing to see this program through. To ensure that we do so I am
         setting a growth rate for defense that we can sustain over the long
         haul.</p>
      <p>The defense program I have proposed for the next five years will require
         some sacrifice, but sacrifice we can well afford.</p>
      <p>The defense program emphasizes four areas:</p>
      <p><span class="war">1. It ensures that our strategic nuclear forces will be equivalent to
            those of the Soviet Union and that deterrence against nuclear war will
            be maintained; 2. It upgrades our forces so that the military balance
            between NATO and the Warsaw Pact will continue to deter the outbreak of
            war, conventional or nuclear, in Europe; 3. It provides us the ability
            to come quickly to the aid of friends and allies around the globe; 4.
            And it ensures that our Navy will continue to be the most powerful on
            the seas.</span></p>
      <p>STRATEGIC FORCES</p>
      <p><span class="war">We are strengthening each of the three legs of our strategic forces. The
            cruise missile production which will begin next year will modernize our
            strategic air deterrent. B-52 capabilities will also be improved.</span> These
         steps will maintain and enhance the B-52 fleet by improving its ability
         to deliver weapons against increasingly heavily defended targets.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We are also modernizing our strategic submarine force. Four more
            POSEIDON submarines backfitted with new, 4,000 mile TRIDENT I missiles
            began deployments in 1980. Nine TRIDENT submarines have been authorized
            through 1981, and we propose one more each year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The new M-X missile program to enhance our land-based intercontinental
            ballistic missile force continues to make progress. Technical
            refinements in the basing design over the last year will result in
            operational benefits, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact.</span> The
         M-X program continues to be an essential ingredient in our strategic
         posture, providing survivability, endurance, secure command and control
         and the capability to threaten targets the Soviets hold dear.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our new systems will enable U.S. strategic forces to maintain
            equivalence in the face of the mounting Soviet challenge. We would
            however need an even greater investment in strategic systems to meet the
            likely Soviet buildup without SALT.</span></p>
      <p>STRATEGIC DOCTRINE</p>
      <p>This Administration's systematic contributions to the necessary
         evolution of strategic doctrine began in 1977 when I commissioned a
         comprehensive net assessment. From that base a number of thorough
         investigations of specific topics continued. I should emphasize that the
         need for an evolutionary doctrine is driven not by any change in our
         basic objective, which remains peace and freedom for all mankind.
         Rather, the need for change is driven by the inexorable buildup of
         Soviet military power and the increasing propensity of Soviet leaders to
         use this power in coercion and outright aggression to impose their will
         on others.</p>
      <p>I have codified our evolving strategic doctrine in a number of
         interrelated and mutually supporting Presidential Directives. Their
         overarching theme is to provide a doctrinal basis, and the specific
         program to implement it, that tells the world that no potential
         adversary of the United States could ever conclude that the fruits of
         his aggression would be significant or worth the enormous costs of our
         retaliation.</p>
      <p>The Presidential Directives include:</p>
      <p>PD-18: An overview of our strategic objectives PD-37: Basic space policy
         PD-41: Civil Defense PD-53: Survivability and endurance for
         telecommunications PD-57: Mobilization planning PD-58: Continuity of
         Government PD-59: Countervailing Strategy for General War.</p>
      <p>These policies have been devised to deter, first and foremost, Soviet
         aggression. As such they confront not only Soviet military forces but
         also Soviet military doctrine. By definition deterrence requires that we
         shape Soviet assessments about the risks of war, assessments they will
         make using their doctrine, not ours.</p>
      <p><span class="war">But at the same time we in no way seek to emulate their doctrine. In
            particular, nothing in our policy contemplates that nuclear warfare
            could ever be a deliberate instrument for achieving our own goals of
            peace and freedom.</span> Moreover, our policies are carefully devised to
         provide the greatest possible incentives and opportunities for future
         progress in arms control.</p>
      <p>Finally, our doctrinal evolution has been undertaken with appropriate
         consultation with our NATO Allies and others. We are fully consistent
         with NATO's strategy of flexible response.</p>
      <p>FORCES FOR NATO</p>
      <p><span class="war">We are greatly accelerating our ability to reinforce Western Europe with
            massive ground and air forces in a crisis. We are undertaking a major
            modernization program for the Army's weapons and equipment, adding
            armor, firepower, and tactical mobility.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are prepositioning more heavy equipment in Europe to help us cope
            with attacks with little warning, and greatly strengthening our airlift
            and sealift capabilities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are also improving our tactical air forces, buying about 1700 new
            fighter and attack aircraft over the next five years, and increasing the
            number of Air Force fighter wings by over 10 percent.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are working closely with our European allies to secure the Host
            Nation Support necessary to enable us to deploy more quickly a greater
            ratio of combat forces to the European theater at a lower cost to the
            United States.</span></p>
      <p>SECURITY ASSISTANCE</p>
      <p><span class="war">As we move to enhance U.S. defense capabilities, we must not lose sight
            of the need to assist others in maintaining their own security and
            independence. Events since World War II, most recently in Southwest
            Asia, have amply demonstrated that U.S. security cannot exist in a
            vacuum, and that our own prospects for peace are closely tied to those
            of our friends.</span> The security assistance programs which I am proposing
         for the coming fiscal year thus directly promote vital U.S. foreign
         policy and national security aims, and are integral parts of our efforts
         to improve and upgrade our own military forces.</p>
      <p><span class="war">More specifically, these programs, which are part of our overall foreign
            aid request, promote U.S. security in two principal ways. First, they
            assist friendly and allied nations to develop the capability to defend
            themselves and maintain their own independence. An example during this
            past year was the timely support provided Thailand to help bolster that
            country's defenses against the large numbers of Soviet-backed Vietnamese
            troops ranged along its eastern frontier.</span> In addition, over the years
         these programs have been important to the continued independence of
         other friends and allies such as Israel, Greece, Turkey and Korea.
         Second, security assistance constitutes an essential element in the
         broad cooperative relationships we have established with many nations
         which permit either U.S. bases on their territory or access by U.S.
         forces to their facilities. These programs have been particularly
         important with regard to the recently-concluded access agreements with
         various countries in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean regions and have
         been crucial to the protection of our interests throughout Southwest
         Asia.</p>
      <p>RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCES</p>
      <p>We are systematically enhancing our ability to respond rapidly to
         non-NATO contingencies wherever required by our commitments or when our
         vital interests are threatened.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The rapid deployment forces we are assembling will be extraordinarily
            flexible: They could range in size from a few ships or air squadrons to
            formations as large as 100,000 men, together with their support. Our
            forces will be prepared for rapid deployment to any region of strategic
            significance.</span></p>
      <p>Among the specific initiatives we are taking to help us respond to
         crises outside of Europe are:</p>
      <p>The development of a new fleet of large cargo aircraft with
         intercontinental range; the design and procurement of a force of
         Maritime Prepositioning Ships that will carry heavy equipment and
         supplies for three Marine Corps brigades; the procurement of fast
         sealift ships to move large quantities of men and material quickly from
         the U.S. to overseas areas of deployment; increasing training and
         exercise activities to ensure that our forces will be well prepared to
         deploy and operate in distant areas.</p>
      <p>In addition, our European allies have agreed on the importance of
         providing support to U.S. deployments to Southwest Asia.</p>
      <p>NAVAL FORCES</p>
      <p><span class="war">Seapower is indispensable to our global position, in peace and also in
            war. Our shipbuilding program will sustain a 550-ship Navy in the 1990's
            and we will continue to build the most capable ships afloat.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The program I have proposed will assure the ability of our Navy to
            operate in high threat areas, to maintain control of the seas and
            protect vital lines of communication, both military and economic and to
            provide the strong maritime component of our rapid deployment forces.</span>
         This is essential for operations in remote areas of the world, where we
         cannot predict far in advance the precise location of trouble, or
         preposition equipment on land.</p>
      <p>MILITARY PERSONNEL</p>
      <p><span class="war">No matter how capable or advanced our weapons systems, our military
            security depends on the abilities, the training and the dedication of
            the people who serve in our armed forces. </span>I am determined to recruit and
         to retain under any foreseeable circumstances an ample level of such
         skilled and experienced military personnel. This Administration has
         supported for FY 1981 the largest peacetime increase ever in military
         pay and allowances.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We have enhanced our readiness and combat endurance by improving the
            Reserve Components. All reservists are assigned to units structured to
            complement and provide needed depth to our active forces.</span> Some reserve
         personnel have also now been equipped with new equipment.</p>
      <p>MOBILIZATION PLANNING</p>
      <p><span class="war">We have completed our first phase of mobilization planning, the first
            such Presidentially-directed effort since World War II. The
            government-wide exercise of our mobilization plans at the end of 1980
            showed, first, that planning pays off and, second, that much more needs
            to be done.</span></p>
      <p>OUR INTELLIGENCE POSTURE</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our national interests are critically dependent on a strong and
            effective intelligence capability. We will maintain and strengthen the
            intelligence capabilities needed to assure our national security.</span>
         Maintenance of and continued improvements in our multi-faceted
         intelligence effort are essential if we are to cope successfully with
         the turbulence and uncertainties of today's world.</p>
      <p>The intelligence budget I have submitted to the Congress responds to our
         needs in a responsible way, providing for significant growth over the
         Fiscal Year 1981 budget. This growth will enable us to develop new
         technical means of intelligence collection while also assuring that the
         more traditional methods of intelligence work are also given proper
         stress. We must continue to integrate both modes of collection in our
         analyses.</p>
      <p>REGIONAL POLICIES</p>
      <p>Every President for over three decades has recognized that America's
         interests are global and that we must pursue a global foreign policy.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Two world wars have made clear our stake in Western Europe and the North
            Atlantic area. We are also inextricably linked with the Far East,
            politically, economically, and militarily. In both of these, the United
            States has a permanent presence and security commitments which would be
            automatically triggered. We have become increasingly conscious of our
            growing interests in a third area, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf
            area.</span></p>
      <p>We have vital stakes in other major regions of the world as well. We
         have long recognized that in an era of interdependence, our own security
         and prosperity depend upon a larger common effort with friends and
         allies throughout the world.</p>
      <p>THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In recognition of the threat which the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
            posed to Western interests in both Europe and Southwest Asia, NATO
            foreign and defense ministers have expressed full support for U.S.
            efforts to develop a capability to respond to a contingency in Southwest
            Asia and have approved an extensive program to help fill the gap which
            could be created by the diversion of U.S. forces to that region.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The U.S. has not been alone in seeking to maintain stability in the
            Southwest Asia area and insure access to the needed resources there. The
            European nations with the capability to do so are improving their own
            forces in the region and providing greater economic and political
            support to the residents of the area.</span> In the face of the potential
         danger posed by the Iran-Iraq conflict, we have developed coordination
         among the Western forces in the area of the Persian Gulf in order to be
         able to safeguard passage in that essential waterway.</p>
      <p>Concerning developments in and around Poland the allies have achieved
         the highest level of cohesion and unity of purpose in making clear the
         effects on future East-West relations of a precipitous Soviet act there.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The alliance has continued to build on the progress of the past three
            years in improving its conventional forces through the Long-Term Defense
            Program.</span> Though economic conditions throughout Europe today are making
         its achievement difficult, the yearly real increase of 3 percent in
         defense spending remains a goal actively sought by the alliance.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The NATO alliance also has moved forward during the past year with the
            implementation of its historic December 1979 decision to modernize its
            Theater Nuclear Force capabilities through deployment of improved
            Pershing ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles in
            Europe. Our allies continue to cooperate actively with us in this
            important joint endeavor, whose purpose is to demonstrate convincingly
            to the Soviet Union the potential costs of a nuclear conflict in Europe.</span>
         At the same time, we offered convincing evidence of our commitment to
         arms control in Europe by initiating preliminary consultations with the
         Soviet Union in Geneva on the subject of negotiated limits on long-range
         theater nuclear forces. Also, during 1980 we initiated and carried out a
         withdrawal from our nuclear weapons stockpile in Europe of 1,000 nuclear
         warheads. This successful drawdown in our nuclear stockpile was a
         further tangible demonstration of our commitment to the updating of our
         existing theater nuclear forces in Europe.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the NATO area, we continued to work closely with other countries in
            providing resources to help Turkey regain economic health. We regretted
            that massive political and internal security problems led the Turkish
            military to take over the government on September 12.</span> The new Turkish
         authorities are making some progress in resolving those problems, and
         they have pledged an early return to civilian government. The tradition
         of the Turkish military gives us cause to take that pledge seriously. We
         welcomed the reestablishment of Greece's links to the integrated
         military command structure of the Atlantic Alliance--a move which we had
         strongly encouraged--as a major step toward strengthening NATO's vital
         southern flank at a time of international crisis and tension in adjacent
         areas. Greek reintegration exemplifies the importance which the allies
         place on cooperating in the common defense and shows that the allies can
         make the difficult decisions necessary to insure their continued
         security. We also welcomed the resumption of the intercommunal talks on
         Cyprus.</p>
      <p>THE U.S. AND THE PACIFIC NATIONS</p>
      <p>The United States is a Pacific nation, as much as it is an Atlantic
         nation.<span class="diplomacy"> Our interests in Asia are as important to us as our interests in
            Europe. Our trade with Asia is as great as our trade with Europe. During
            the past four years we have regained a strong, dynamic and flexible
            posture for the United States in this vital region.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our major alliances with Japan, Australia and New Zealand are now
            stronger than they ever have been, and together with the nations of
            western Europe, we have begun to form the basic political structure for
            dealing with international crises that affect us all. Japan, Australia
            and New Zealand have given us strong support in developing a strategy
            for responding to instability in the Persian Gulf.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Normalization of U.S. relations with China has facilitated China's full
            entry into the international community and encouraged a constructive
            Chinese role in the Asia-Pacific region. Our relations with China have
            been rapidly consolidated over the past year through the conclusion of a
            series of bilateral agreements.</span> We have established a pattern of
         frequent and frank consultations between our two governments,
         exemplified by a series of high-level visits and by regular exchanges at
         the working level, through which we have been able to identify
         increasingly broad areas of common interest on which we can cooperate.</p>
      <p>United States relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
         (ASEAN) have also expanded dramatically in the past four years. ASEAN is
         now the focus for U.S. policy in Southeast Asia, and its cohesion and
         strength are essential to stability in this critical area and beyond.</p>
      <p>Soviet-supported Vietnamese aggression in Indo-china has posed a major
         challenge to regional stability. In response, we have reiterated our
         security commitment to Thailand and have provided emergency security
         assistance for Thai forces facing a Vietnamese military threat along the
         Thai-Cambodian border. We have worked closely with ASEAN and the U.N. to
         press for withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia and to encourage
         a political settlement in Cambodia which permits that nation to be
         governed by leaders of its own choice. We still look forward to the day
         when Cambodia peacefully can begin the process of rebuilding its social,
         economic and political institutions, after years of devastation and
         occupation. And, on humanitarian grounds and in support of our friends
         in the region, we have worked vigorously with international
         organizations to arrange relief and resettlement for the exodus of
         Indo-chinese refugees which threatened to overwhelm these nations.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have maintained our alliance with Korea and helped assure Korea's
            security during a difficult period of political transition.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have amended our military base agreement with the Philippines,
            ensuring stable access to these bases through 1991. The importance of
            our Philippine bases to the strategic flexibility of U.S. forces and our
            access to the Indian Ocean is self-evident.</span></p>
      <p>Finally, we are in the process of concluding a long negotiation
         establishing Micronesia's status as a freely associated state.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We enter the 1980's with a firm strategic footing in East Asia and the
            Pacific, based on stable and productive U.S. relations with the majority
            of countries of the region. We have established a stable level of U.S.
            involvement in the region, appropriate to our own interests and to the
            interests of our friends and allies there.</span></p>
      <p>THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTHWEST ASIA</p>
      <p><span class="war">The continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the dislocations
            caused by the Iraq-Iran war serve as constant reminders of the critical
            importance for us, and our allies, of a third strategic zone stretching
            across the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and much of the Indian
            subcontinent. </span>This Southwest Asian region has served as a key strategic
         and commercial link between East and West over the centuries. Today it
         produces two-thirds of the world's oil exports, providing most of the
         energy needs of our European allies and Japan. It has experienced almost
         continuous conflict between nations, internal instabilities in many
         countries, and regional rivalries, combined with very rapid economic and
         social change. And now the Soviet Union remains in occupation of one of
         these nations, ignoring world opinion which has called on it to get out.</p>
      <p>We have taken several measures to meet these challenges.</p>
      <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the Middle East, our determination to consolidate what has already
            been achieved in the peace process--and to buttress that accomplishment
            with further progress toward a comprehensive peace settlement--must
            remain a central goal of our foreign policy.</span> Pursuant to their peace
         treaty, Egypt and Israel have made steady progress in the normalization
         of their relations in a variety of fields, bringing the benefits of
         peace directly to their people. The new relationship between Egypt and
         Israel stands as an example of peaceful cooperation in an increasingly
         fragmented and turbulent region.</p>
      <p>Both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin remain committed to the
         current negotiations to provide full autonomy to the inhabitants of the
         West Bank and Gaza. These negotiations have been complex and difficult,
         but they have already made significant progress, and it is vital that
         the two sides, with our assistance, see the process through to a
         successful conclusion. We also recognize the need to broaden the peace
         process to include other parties to the conflict and believe that a
         successful autonomy agreement is an essential first step toward this
         objective.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have also taken a number of steps to strengthen our bilateral
            relations with both Israel and Egypt. We share important strategic
            interests with both of these countries.</span></p>
      <p>We remain committed to Israel's security and are prepared to take
         concrete steps to support Israel whenever that security is threatened.</p>
      <p>PERSIAN GULF</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The Persian Gulf has been a vital crossroads for trade between Europe
            and Asia at many key moments in history. It has become essential in
            recent years for its supply of oil to the United States, our allies, and
            our friends. We have taken effective measures to control our own
            consumption of imported fuel, working in cooperation with the other key
            industrial / nations of the world.</span> However, there is little doubt that
         the healthy growth of our American and world economies will depend for
         many years on continued safe access to the Persian Gulf's oil
         production. The denial of these oil supplies would threaten not only our
         own but world security.</p>
      <p>The potent new threat from an advancing Soviet Union, against the
         background of regional instability of which it can take advantage,
         requires that we reinforce our ability to defend our regional friends
         and to protect the flow of oil. We are continuing to build on the strong
         political, economic, social and humanitarian ties which bind this
         government and the American people to friendly governments and peoples
         of the Persian Gulf.</p>
      <p>We have also embarked on a course to reinforce the trust and confidence
         our regional friends have in our ability to come to their assistance
         rapidly with American military force if needed. We have increased our
         naval presence in the Indian Ocean. We have created a Rapid Deployment
         Force which can move quickly to the Gulf--or indeed any other area of
         the world where outside aggression threatens. We have concluded several
         agreements with countries which are prepared to let us use their
         airports and naval facilities in an emergency. We have met requests for
         reasonable amounts of American weaponry from regional countries which
         are anxious to defend themselves. And we are discussing with a number of
         our area friends further ways we can help to improve their security and
         ours, both for the short and the longer term.</p>
      <p>SOUTH ASIA</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We seek a South Asia comprising sovereign and stable states, free of
            outside interference, which can strengthen their political institutions
            according to their own national genius and can develop their economies
            for the betterment of their people.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has posed a new challenge to this
            region, and particularly to neighboring Pakistan. We are engaged in a
            continuing dialogue with the Pakistan government concerning its
            development and security requirements and the economic burden imposed by
            Afghan refugees who have fled to Pakistan.</span> We are participating with
         other aid consortium members in debt rescheduling and will continue to
         cooperate through the UNHCR in providing refugee assistance. We remain
         committed to Pakistan's territorial integrity and independence.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Developments in the broad South/Southwest Asian region have also lent a
            new importance to our relations with India, the largest and strongest
            power in the area. We share India's interest in a more constructive
            relationship. Indian policies and perceptions at times differ from our
            own, and we have established a candid dialogue with this sister
            democracy which seeks to avoid the misunderstandings which have
            sometimes complicated our ties.</span></p>
      <p>We attach major importance to strong economic assistance programs to the
         countries in the area, which include a majority of the poor of the
         non-Communist world. We believe that these programs will help achieve
         stability in the area, an objective we share with the countries in the
         region. Great progress has been achieved by these countries in
         increasing food production; international cooperation in harnessing the
         great river resources of South Asia would contribute further to this
         goal and help to increase energy production.</p>
      <p>We continue to give high priority to our non-proliferation goals in the
         area in the context of our broad global and regional priorities. The
         decision to continue supply of nuclear fuel to the Indian Tarapur
         reactors was sensitive to this effort.</p>
      <p>AFRICA</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The United States has achieved a new level of trust and cooperation with
            Africa. Our efforts, together with our allies, to achieve peace in
            southern Africa, our increased efforts to help the poorest countries in
            Africa to combat poverty, and our expanded efforts to promote trade and
            investment have led to growing respect for the U.S. and to cooperation
            in areas of vital interest to the United States.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Africa is a continent of poor nations for the most part.</span> It also
         contains many of the mineral resources vital for our economy. We have
         worked with Africa in a spirit of mutual cooperation to help the African
         nations solve their problems of poverty and to develop stronger ties
         between our private sector and African economies. Our assistance to
         Africa has more than doubled in the last four years. Equally important,
         we set in motion new mechanisms for private investment and trade.</p>
      <p>Nigeria is the largest country in Black Africa and the second largest
         oil supplier to the United States. <span class="diplomacy">During this Administration we have
            greatly expanded and improved our relationship with Nigeria and other
            West African states whose aspirations for a constitutional democratic
            order we share and support. This interest was manifested both
            symbolically and practically by the visit of Vice President Mondale to
            West Africa in July (1980) and the successful visit to Washington of the
            President of Nigeria in October.</span></p>
      <p>During Vice President Mondale's visit, a Joint Agricultural Consultative
         Committee was established, with the U.S. represented entirely by the
         private sector. This could herald a new role for the American private
         sector in helping solve the world's serious food shortages. I am pleased
         to say that our relations with Nigeria are at an all-time high,
         providing the foundation for an even stronger relationship in the years
         ahead.</p>
      <p>Another tenet of this Administration's approach to African problems has
         been encouragement and support for regional solutions to Africa's
         problems. We have supported initiatives by the Organization of African
         Unity to solve the protracted conflict in the western Sahara, Chad, and
         the Horn. In Chad, the world is watching with dismay as a country torn
         by a devastating civil war has become a fertile field for Libya's
         exploitation, thus demonstrating that threats to peace can come from
         forces within as well as without Africa.</p>
      <p>In southern Africa the United States continues to pursue a policy of
         encouraging peaceful development toward majority rule. In 1980, Southern
         Rhodesia became independent as Zimbabwe, a multiracial nation under a
         system of majority rule. Zimbabwean independence last April was the
         culmination of a long struggle within the country and diplomatic efforts
         involving Great Britain, African states neighboring Zimbabwe, and the
         United States.</p>
      <p>The focus of our efforts in pursuit of majority rule in southern Africa
         has now turned to Namibia. Negotiations are proceeding among concerned
         parties under the leadership of U.N. Secretary General Waldheim. This
         should lead to implementation of the U.N. plan for self-determination
         and independence for Namibia during 1981. If these negotiations are
         successfully concluded, sixty-five years of uncertainty over the status
         of the territory, including a seven-year-long war, will be ended.</p>
      <p>In response to our active concern with issues of importance to Africans,
         African states have cooperated with us on issues of importance to our
         national interests. African states voted overwhelmingly in favor of the
         U.N. Resolution calling for release of the hostages, and for the U.N.
         Resolution condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Two countries
         of Africa have signed access agreements with the U.S. allowing us use of
         naval and air facilities in the Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Africans have become increasingly vocal on human rights. African leaders
            have spoken out on the issue of political prisoners, and the OAU is
            drafting its own Charter on Human Rights.</span> Three countries in Africa--
         Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda--have returned to civilian rule during the
         past year.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">U.S. cooperation with Africa on all these matters represents a strong
            base on which we can build in future years.</span></p>
      <p>Liberia is a country of long-standing ties with the U.S. and the site of
         considerable U.S. investment and facilities. This past April a coup
         replaced the government and a period of political and economic
         uncertainty ensued. The U.S. acted swiftly to meet this situation. We,
         together with African leaders, urged the release of political prisoners,
         and many have been released; we provided emergency economic assistance
         to help avoid economic collapse, and helped to involve the IMF and the
         banking community to bring about economic stability; and we have worked
         closely with the new leaders to maintain Liberia's strong ties with the
         West and to protect America's vital interests.</p>
      <p>NORTH AFRICA</p>
      <p>In early 1979, following a Libyan-inspired commando attack on a Tunisian
         provincial city, the U.S. responded promptly to Tunisia's urgent request
         for assistance, both by airlifting needed military equipment and by
         making clear our longstanding interest in the security and integrity of
         this friendly country. The U.S. remains determined to oppose other
         irresponsible Libyan aspirations. Despairing of a productive dialogue
         with the Libyan authorities, the U.S. closed down its embassy in Libya
         and later expelled six Libyan diplomats in Washington in order to deter
         an intimidation campaign against Libyan citizens in the U.S.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">U.S. relations with Algeria have improved, and Algeria has played an
            indispensable and effective role as intermediary between Iran and the
            U.S. over the hostage issue.</span></p>
      <p>The strengthening of our arms supply relationship with Morocco has
         helped to deal with attacks inside its internationally recognized
         frontiers and to strengthen its confidence in seeking a political
         settlement of the Western Sahara conflict. While not assuming a
         mediatory role, the U.S. encouraged all interested parties to turn their
         energies to a peaceful and sensible compromise resolution of the war in
         the Sahara and supported efforts by the Organization of African Unity
         toward that end. As the year drew to a close, the U.S. was encouraged by
         evolution in the attitudes of all sides, and is hopeful that their
         differences will be peacefully resolved in the year ahead so that the
         vast economic potential of North Africa can be developed for the
         well-being of the people living there.</p>
      <p>LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN</p>
      <p>The principles of our policies in this hemisphere have been clear and
         constant over the last four years. We support democracy and respect for
         human rights. We have struggled with many to help free the region of
         both repression and terrorism. We have respected ideological diversity
         and opposed outside intervention in purely internal affairs. We will
         act, though, in response to a request for assistance by a country
         threatened by external aggression. We support social and economic
         development within a democratic framework. We support the peaceful
         settlement of disputes. We strongly encourage regional cooperation and
         shared responsibilities within the hemisphere to all these ends, and we
         have eagerly and regularly sought the advice of the leaders of the
         region on a wide range of issues.</p>
      <p>Last November, I spoke to the General Assembly of the Organization of
         American States of a cause that has been closest to my heart--human
         rights. It is an issue that has found its time in the hemisphere. The
         cause is not mine alone, but an historic movement that will endure.</p>
      <p>At Riobamba, Ecuador, last September four Andean Pact countries, Costa
         Rica, and Panama broke new ground by adopting a "Code of Conduct," that
         joint action in defense of human rights does not violate the principles
         of nonintervention in the internal affairs of states in this hemisphere.
         The Organization of American States has twice condemned the coup that
         overturned the democratic process in Bolivia and the widespread abuse of
         human rights by the regime which seized power. The Inter-American
         Commission on Human Rights has gained world acclaim for its
         dispassionate reports. It completed two major country studies this year
         in addition to its annual report. In a resolution adopted without
         opposition, the OAS General Assembly in November strongly supported the
         work of the Commission. The American Convention on Human Rights is in
         force and an Inter-American Court has been created to judge human rights
         violations. This convention has been pending before the Senate for two
         years; I hope the United States this year will join the other nations of
         the hemisphere in ratifying a convention which embodies principles that
         are our tradition.</p>
      <p>The trend in favor of democracy has continued. During this past year,
         Peru inaugurated a democratically elected government. Brazil continues
         its process of liberalization. In Central America, Hondurans voted in
         record numbers in their first national elections in over eight years. In
         the Caribbean seven elections have returned governments firmly committed
         to the democratic traditions of the Commonwealth.</p>
      <p>Another major contribution to peace in the hemisphere is Latin America's
         own Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. On behalf of the
         United States, I signed Protocol I of this Treaty in May of 1977 and
         sent it to the Senate for ratification. I urge that it be acted upon
         promptly by the Senate in order that it be brought into the widest
         possible effect in the Latin American region.</p>
      <p>Regional cooperation for development is gaining from Central America to
         the Andes, and throughout the Caribbean. The Caribbean Group for
         Cooperation in Economic Development, which we established with 29 other
         nations in 1977, has helped channel $750 million in external support for
         growth in the Caribbean. The recent meeting of the Chiefs of State of
         the Eastern Caribbean set a new precedent for cooperation in that
         region. Mexico and Venezuela jointly and Trinidad and Tobago separately
         have established oil facilities that will provide substantial assistance
         to their oil importing neighbors. The peace treaty between El Salvador
         and Honduras will hopefully stimulate Central America to move forward
         again toward economic integration. Formation of Caribbean/ Central
         American Action, a private sector organization, has given a major
         impetus to improving people-to-people bonds and strengthening the role
         of private enterprise in the development of democratic societies.</p>
      <p>The Panama treaties have been in force for over a year. A new
         partnership has been created with Panama; it is a model for large and
         small nations. A longstanding issue that divided us from our neighbors
         has been resolved. The security of the canal has been enhanced. The
         canal is operating as well as ever, with traffic through it reaching
         record levels this year. Canal employees, American and Panamanian alike,
         have remained on the job and have found their living and working
         conditions virtually unchanged.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In 1980, relations with Mexico continued to improve due in large measure
            to the effectiveness of the Coordinator for Mexican Affairs and the
            expanded use of the U.S.-Mexico Consultative Mechanism.</span> By holding
         periodic meetings of its various working groups, we have been able to
         prevent mutual concerns from becoming political issues. The Secretary of
         State visited Mexico City in November, and, along with the Mexican
         Secretary of Foreign Relations, reviewed the performance of the
         Consultative Mechanism. The office of the Coordinator has ensured the
         implementation of my directive to all agencies to accord high priority
         to Mexican concerns. Trade with Mexico rose by almost 60 percent to
         nearly $30 billion, making that country our third largest trading
         partner.</p>
      <p>These are all encouraging developments. Other problems remain, however.</p>
      <p>The impact of large-scale migration is affecting many countries in the
         hemisphere. The most serious manifestation was the massive, illegal
         exodus from Cuba last summer. The Cuban government unilaterally
         encouraged the disorderly and even deadly migration of 125,000 of its
         citizens in complete disregard for international law or the immigration
         laws of its neighbors. Migrations of this nature clearly require
         concerted action, and we have asked the OAS to explore means of dealing
         with similar situations which may occur in the future.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have a long-standing treaty with Colombia on Quita Sueno, Roncador,
            and Serrano which remains to be ratified by the Senate.</span></p>
      <p>In Central America, the future of Nicaragua is unclear. Recent tensions,
         the restrictions on the press and political activity, an inordinate
         Cuban presence in the country and the tragic killing by the security
         forces of a businessman well known for his democratic orientation, cause
         us considerable concern. These are not encouraging developments. But
         those who seek a free society remain in the contest for their nation's
         destiny. They have asked us to help rebuild their country, and by our
         assistance, to demonstrate that the democratic nations do not intend to
         abandon Nicaragua to the Cubans. As long as those who intend to pursue
         their pluralistic goals play important roles in Nicaragua, it deserves
         our continuing support.</p>
      <p>In El Salvador, we have supported the efforts of the Junta to change the
         fundamental basis of an inequitable system and to give a stake in a new
         nation to those millions of people, who for so long, lived without hope
         or dignity. As the government struggles against those who would restore
         an old tyranny or impose a new one, the United States will continue to
         stand behind them.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have increased our aid to the Caribbean, an area vital to our
            national security, and we should continue to build close relations based
            on mutual respect and understanding, and common interests.</span></p>
      <p>As the nations of this hemisphere prepare to move further into the
         1980's, I am struck by the depth of underlying commitment that there is
         to our common principles: non-intervention, peaceful settlement of
         disputes, cooperation for development, democracy and defense of basic
         human rights. I leave office satisfied that the political, economic,
         social and organizational basis for further progress with respect to all
         these principles have been substantially strengthened in the past four
         years. I am particularly reassured by the leadership by other nations of
         the hemisphere in advancing these principles. The success of our common
         task of improving the circumstances of all peoples and nations in the
         hemisphere can only be assured by the sharing of responsibility. I look
         forward to a hemisphere that at the end of this decade has proven itself
         anew as a leader in the promotion of both national and human dignity.</p>
      <p>THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">A growing defense effort and a vigorous foreign policy rest upon a
               strong economy here in the United States. And the strength of our own
               economy depends upon our ability to lead and compete in the
               international marketplace.</span></span></p>
      <p>ENERGY</p>
      <p><span class="war">Last year, the war between Iraq and Iran led to the loss of nearly 4
            million barrels of oil to world markets, the third major oil market
            disruption in the past seven years</span>. This crisis has vividly demonstrated
         once again both the value of lessened dependence on oil imports and the
         continuing instability of the Persian Gulf area.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of the United States, the 21 members of the
         International Energy Agency took collective action to ensure that the
         oil shortfall stemming from the Iran-Iraq war would not be aggravated by
         competition for scarce spot market supplies. We are also working
         together to see that those nations most seriously affected by the oil
         disruption-- including our key NATO allies Turkey and Portugal--can get
         the oil they need. At the most recent IEA Ministerial meeting we joined
         the other members in pledging to take those policy measures necessary to
         slice our joint oil imports in the first quarter of 1981 by 2.2 million
         barrels.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our international cooperation efforts in the energy field are not
            limited to crisis management.</span> At the Economic Summit meetings in Tokyo
         and Venice, the heads of government of the seven major industrial
         democracies agreed to a series of tough energy conservation and
         production goals. We are working together with all our allies and
         friends in this effort.</p>
      <p>Construction has begun on a commercial scale coal liquefaction plant in
         West Virginia co-financed by the United States, Japan and West Germany.
         An interagency task force has just reported to me on a series of
         measures we need to take to increase coal production and exports. This
         report builds on the work of the International Energy Agency's Coal
         Industry Advisory Board. With the assurances of a reliable United States
         steam coal supply at reasonable prices, many of the electric power
         plants to be built in the 1980's and 1990's can be coal-fired rather
         than oil-burning.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are working cooperatively with other nations to increase energy
            security in other areas as well.</span> Joint research and development with our
         allies is underway in solar energy, nuclear power, industrial
         conservation and other areas. In addition, we are assisting rapidly
         industrializing nations to carefully assess their basic energy policy
         choices, and our development assistance program helps the developing
         countries to increase indigenous energy production to meet the energy
         needs of their poorest citizens. We support the proposal for a new World
         Bank energy affiliate to these same ends, whose fulfillment will
         contribute to a better global balance between energy supply and demand.</p>
      <p>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY POLICY</p>
      <p>Despite the rapid increase in oil costs, the policy measures we have
         taken to improve domestic economic performance have had a continued
         powerful effect on our external accounts and on the strength of the
         dollar. A strong dollar helps in the fight against inflation.</p>
      <p>There has also been considerable forward movement in efforts to improve
         the functioning of the international monetary system. The stability of
         the international system of payments and trade is important to the
         stability and good health of our own economy. We have given strong
         support to the innovative steps being taken by the International
         Monetary Fund and World Bank to help promote early adjustment to the
         difficult international economic problems. Recent agreement to increase
         quotas by fifty percent will ensure the IMF has sufficient resources to
         perform its central role in promoting adjustment and financing payments
         imbalances. The World Bank's new structural adjustment lending program
         will also make an important contribution to international efforts to
         help countries achieve a sustainable level of growth and development.</p>
      <p>SUGAR</p>
      <p>In 1980, Congress passed U.S. implementing legislation for the
         International Sugar Agreement, thus fulfilling a major commitment of
         this Administration. The agreement is an important element in our
         international commodity policy with far-reaching implications for our
         relations with developing countries, particularly sugar producers in
         Latin America. Producers and consumers alike will benefit from a more
         stable market for this essential commodity.</p>
      <p>COFFEE</p>
      <p>At year's end, Congress approved implementing legislation permitting the
         U.S. to carry out fully its commitments under International Coffee
         Agreement Specifically, the legislation enables us to meet our part of
         an understanding negotiated last fall among members of the Agreement,
         which defends, by use of export quotas, a price range well below coffee
         prices of previous years and which commits major coffee producers to
         eliminate cartel arrangements that manipulated future markets to raise
         prices. The way is now open to a fully-functioning International Coffee
         Agreement which can help to stabilize this major world commodity market.
         The results will be positive for both consumers--who will be less likely
         to suffer from sharp increases in coffee prices--and producers--who can
         undertake future investment with assurance of greater protection against
         disruptive price fluctuations in their exports.</p>
      <p>NATURAL RUBBER</p>
      <p>In 1980, the International Natural Rubber Agreement entered into force
         provisionally. U.S. membership in this new body was approved
         overwhelmingly by the Senate last year. The natural rubber agreement is
         a model of its kind and should make a substantial contribution to a
         stable world market in this key industrial commodity. It is thus an
         excellent example of constructive steps to improve the operation of the
         world economy in ways which can benefit the developing and
         industrialized countries alike. In particular, the agreement has
         improved important U.S. relationships with the major natural
         rubber-producing countries of Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>COMMON FUND</p>
      <p>The United States joined members of the United Nations Conference on
         Trade and Development, both developed and developing nations, in
         concluding Articles of Agreement in 1980 for a Common Fund to help
         international commodity agreements stabilize the prices of raw
         materials.</p>
      <p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our relations with the developing nations are of major importance to the
            United States.</span> The fabric of our relations with these countries has
         strong economic and political dimensions. They constitute the most
         rapidly growing markets for our exports, and are important sources of
         fuel and raw materials. Their political views are increasingly
         important, as demonstrated in their overwhelming condemnation of the
         Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our ability to work together with
         developing nations toward goals we have in common (their political
         independence, the resolution of regional tensions, and our growing ties
         of trade for example) require us to maintain the policy of active
         involvement with the developing world that we have pursued over the past
         four years.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The actions we have taken in such areas as energy, trade, commodities,
            and international financial institutions are all important to the
            welfare of the developing countries.</span> Another important way the United
         States can directly assist these countries and demonstrate our concern
         for their future is through our multilateral and bilateral foreign
         assistance program. The legislation which I will be submitting to you
         for FY 82 provides the authority and the funds to carry on this
         activity. Prompt Congressional action on this legislation is essential
         in order to attack such high priority global problems as food and
         energy, meet our treaty and base rights agreements, continue our peace
         efforts in the Middle East, provide economic and development support to
         countries in need, promote progress on North-South issues, protect
         Western interests, and counter Soviet influence.</p>
      <p>Our proposed FY 1982 bilateral development aid program is directly
         responsive to the agreement reached at the 1980 Venice Economic Summit
         that the major industrial nations should increase their aid for food and
         energy production and for family planning. We understand that other
         Summit countries plan similar responses. It is also important to honor
         our international agreements for multilateral assistance by authorizing
         and appropriating funds for the International Financial Institutions.
         These multilateral programs enhance the efficiency of U.S. contributions
         by combining them with those of many other donor countries to promote
         development; the proposed new World Bank affiliate to increase energy
         output in developing countries offers particular promise. All these
         types of aid benefit our long-run economic and political interests.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Progress was made on a number of economic issues in negotiations
            throughout the U.N. system.</span> However, in spite of lengthy efforts in the
         United Nations, agreement has not been reached on how to launch a
         process of Global Negotiations in which nations might collectively work
         to solve such important issues as energy, food, protectionism, and
         population pressures. The United States continues to believe that
         progress can best be made when nations focus on such specific problems,
         rather than on procedural and institutional questions. It will continue
         to work to move the North-South dialogue into a more constructive phase.</p>
      <p>FOOD--THE WAR ON HUNGER</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">The War on Hunger must be a continuous urgent priority. Major portions
            of the world's population continue to be threatened by the specter of
            hunger and malnutrition. During the past year, some 150 million people
            in 36 African countries were faced with near disaster as the result of
            serious drought, induced food shortages.</span> Our government, working in
         concert with the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), helped
         to respond to that need. But the problems of hunger cannot be solved by
         short-term measures. We must continue to support those activities,
         bilateral and multilateral, which aim at improving food production
         especially in developing countries and assuring global food security.
         These measures are necessary to the maintenance of a stable and healthy
         world economy.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I am pleased that negotiation of a new Food Aid Convention, which
            guarantees a minimum annual level of food assistance, was successfully
            concluded in March.</span> The establishment of the International Emergency
         Wheat Reserve will enable the U.S. to meet its commitment under the new
         Convention to feed hungry people, even in times of short supply.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Of immediate concern is the prospect of millions of Africans threatened
            by famine because of drought and civil disturbances. The U.S. plea for
            increased food aid resulted in the organization of an international
            pledging conference and we are hopeful that widespread starvation will
            be avoided.</span></p>
      <p>Good progress has been made since the Venice Economic Summit called for
         increased effort on this front. We and other donor countries have begun
         to assist poor countries develop long-term strategies to improve their
         food production. <span class="poverty">The World Bank will invest up to $4 billion in the next
            few years in improving the grain storage and food-handling capacity of
            countries prone to food shortages.</span></p>
      <p>Good progress has been made since the Tokyo Economic Summit called for
         increased effort on this front. The World Bank is giving this problem
         top priority, as are some other donor countries. The resources of the
         consultative Group on International Agricultural Research will be
         doubled over a five-year period. The work of our own Institute of
         Scientific and Technological Cooperation will further strengthen the
         search for relevant new agricultural technologies.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">The goal of freeing the world from hunger by the year 2000 should
            command the full support of all countries.</span></p>
      <p>The Human Dimension of Foreign Policy</p>
      <p>HUMAN RIGHTS</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The human rights policy of the United States has been an integral part
            of our overall foreign policy for the past several years.</span> This policy
         serves the national interest of the United States in several important
         ways: by encouraging respect by governments for the basic rights of
         human beings, it promotes peaceful, constructive change, reduces the
         likelihood of internal pressures for violent change and for the
         exploitation of these by our adversaries, and thus directly serves our
         long-term interest in peace and stability; by matching espousal of
         fundamental American principles of freedom with specific foreign policy
         actions, we stand out in vivid contrast to our ideological adversaries;
         by our efforts to expand freedom elsewhere, we render our own freedom,
         and our own nation, more secure. Countries that respect human rights
         make stronger allies and better friends.</p>
      <p>Rather than attempt to dictate what system of government or institutions
         other countries should have, the U.S. supports, throughout the world,
         the internationally recognized human rights which all members of the
         United Nations have pledged themselves to respect. There is more than
         one model that can satisfy the continuing human reach for freedom and
         justice:</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">1980 has been a year of some disappointments, but has also seen some
            positive developments in the ongoing struggle for fulfillment of human
            rights throughout the world.</span> In the year we have seen:</p>
      <p>--Free elections were held and democratic governments installed in Peru,
         Dominica, and Jamaica. Honduras held a free election for installation of
         a constituent assembly. An interim government was subsequently named
         pointing toward national presidential elections in 1981. Brazil
         continues on its course of political liberalization.</p>
      <p>--The "Charter of Conduct" signed in Riobamba, Ecuador, by Ecuador,
         Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Spain, affirms the
         importance of democracy and human rights for the Andean countries.</p>
      <p>--The Organization of American States, in its annual General Assembly,
         approved a resolution in support of the Inter-American Human Rights
         Commission's work. The resolution took note of the Commission's annual
         report, which described the status of human rights in Chile, El
         Salvador, Paraguay and Uruguay; and the special reports on Argentina and
         Haiti, which described human rights conditions as investigated during
         on-site inspections to these countries.</p>
      <p>--The awarding of the Nobel Prize for Peace to Adolfo Perez Esquivel of
         Argentina for his non-violent advocacy of human rights.</p>
      <p>--The United States was able to rejoin the International Labor
         Organization after an absence of two years, as that U.N. body reformed
         its procedures to return to its original purpose of strengthening
         employer-employee-government relations to insure human rights for the
         working people of the world.</p>
      <p>The United States, of course, cannot take credit for all these various
         developments. But we can take satisfaction in knowing that our policies
         encourage and perhaps influence them.</p>
      <p>Those who see a contradiction between our security and our humanitarian
         interests forget that the basis for a secure and stable society is the
         bond of trust between a government and its people. I profoundly believe
         that the future of our world is not to be found in authoritarianism:
         that wears the mask of order, or totalitarianism that wears the mask of
         justice. Instead, let us find our future in the human face of democracy,
         the human voice of individual liberty, the human hand of economic
         development.</p>
      <p>HUMANITARIAN AID</p>
      <p><span class="war">The United States has continued to play its traditional role of
            safehaven for those who flee or are forced to flee their homes because
            of persecution or war. During 1980, the United States provided
            resettlement opportunities for 216,000 refugees from countries around
            the globe.</span> In addition, the United States joined with other nations to
         provide relief to refugees in country of first asylum in Africa, the
         Middle East, and Asia.</p>
      <p>The great majority of refugee admissions continued to be from
         Indo-china. During 1980, 168,000 Indo-chinese were resettled in the
         United States. Although refugee populations persist in camps in
         Southeast Asia, and refugees continue to flee Vietnam, Laos and
         Kampuchea, the flow is not as great as in the past. One factor in
         reducing the flow from Vietnam has been the successful negotiation and
         commencement of an Orderly Departure Program which permits us to process
         Vietnamese for resettlement in the United States with direct departure
         from Ho Chi Minh Ville in an orderly fashion. The first group of 250
         departed Vietnam for the United States in December, 1980.</p>
      <p>In addition to the refugees admitted last year, the United States
         accepted for entry into the United States 125,000 Cubans who were
         expelled by Fidel Castro. Federal and state authorities, as well as
         private voluntary agencies, responded with unprecedented vigor to coping
         with the unexpected influx of Cubans.</p>
      <p>Major relief efforts to aid refugees in countries of first asylum
         continued in several areas of the world. In December, 1980, thirty-two
         nations, meeting in New York City, agreed to contribute $65 million to
         the continuing famine relief program in Kampuchea. Due in great part to
         the generosity of the American people and the leadership exercised in
         the international arena by the United States, we have played the pivotal
         role in ameliorating massive suffering in Kampuchea.</p>
      <p>The United States has taken the lead among a group of donor countries
         who are providing relief to some two million refugees in the Horn of
         Africa who have been displaced by fighting in Ethiopia. U.S. assistance,
         primarily to Somalia, consists of $35 million worth of food and $18
         million in cash and kind. Here again, United States efforts can in large
         part be credited with keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive.</p>
      <p>Another major international relief effort has been mounted in Pakistan.
         The United States is one of 25 countries plus the European Economic
         Community who have been helping the Government of Pakistan to cope with
         the problem of feeding and sheltering the more than one million refugees
         that have been generated by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>In April, 1980, the Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980 which
         brought together, for the first time, in one piece of legislation the
         various threads of U.S. policy towards refugees. The law laid down a
         new, broader definition of the term refugee, established mechanisms for
         arriving at a level of refugee admissions through consultation with
         Congress, and established the Office of the United States Coordinator
         for Refugees.</p>
      <p>It cannot be ignored that the destructive and aggressive policies of the
         Soviet Union have added immeasurably to the suffering in these three
         tragic situations.</p>
      <p>The Control of Nuclear Weapons</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="civil-rights">Together with our friends and allies, we are striving to build a world
               in which peoples with diverse interests can live freely and prosper. But
               all that humankind has achieved to date, all that we are seeking to
               accomplish, and human existence itself can be undone in an instant--in
               the catastrophe of a nuclear war.</span></span></p>
      <p>Thus one of the central objectives of my Administration has been to
         control the proliferation of nuclear weapons to those nations which do
         not have them, and their further development by the existing nuclear
         powers-- notably the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
      <p>NON-PROLIFERATION</p>
      <p><span class="war">My Administration has been committed to stemming the spread of nuclear
            weapons. Nuclear proliferation would raise the spectre of the use of
            nuclear explosives in crucial, unstable regions of the world endangering
            not only our security and that of our Allies, but that of the whole
            world.</span> Non-proliferation is not and can not be a unilateral U.S. policy,
         nor should it be an issue of contention between the industrialized and
         developing states. The international non-proliferation effort requires
         the support of suppliers as well as importers of nuclear technology and
         materials.</p>
      <p>We have been proceeding on a number of fronts:</p>
      <p>--First, we have been seeking to encourage nations to accede to the
         Non-Proliferation Treaty. The U.S. is also actively encouraging other
         nations to accept full-scope safeguards on all of their nuclear
         activities and is asking other nuclear suppliers to adopt a full-scope
         safeguards requirement as a condition for future supply.</p>
      <p>--Second, the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE), which
         was completed in 1980, demonstrated that suppliers and recipients can
         work together on these technically complex and sensitive issues. While
         differences remain, the INFCE effort provides a broader international
         basis for national decisions which must balance energy needs with
         non-proliferation concerns.</p>
      <p>--Finally, we are working to encourage regional cooperation and
         restraint. Protocol I of the Treaty of Tlatelolco which will contribute
         to the lessening of nuclear dangers for our Latin American neighbors
         ought now to be ratified by the United States Senate.</p>
      <p>LIMITATIONS ON STRATEGIC ARMS</p>
      <p>I remain convinced that the SALT II Treaty is in our Nation's security
         interest and that it would add significantly to the control of nuclear
         weapons. I strongly support continuation of the SALT process and the
         negotiation of more far-reaching mutual restraints on nuclear weaponry.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSION</p>
      <p>We have new support in the world for our purposes of national
         independence and individual human dignity. We have a new will at home to
         do what is required to keep us the strongest nation on earth.</p>
      <p>We must move together into this decade with the strength which comes
         from realization of the dangers before us and from the confidence that
         together we can overcome them.  The White House, January 16, 1981.

      <h3>January 26, 1982</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress,
         honored guests, and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>Today marks my first State of the Union address to you, a constitutional
         duty as old as our Republic itself.</p>
      <p>President Washington began this tradition in 1790 after reminding the
         Nation that the destiny of self-government and the "preservation of the
         sacred fire of liberty" is "finally staked on the experiment entrusted
         to the hands of the American people." For our friends in the press, who
         place a high premium on accuracy, let me say: I did not actually hear
         George Washington say that. But it is a matter of historic record.</p>
      <p>But from this podium, Winston Churchill asked the free world to stand
         together against the onslaught of aggression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt
         spoke of a day of infamy and summoned a nation to arms. Douglas
         MacArthur made an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and
         served so well. Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased
         only at the price of strength. And John F. Kennedy spoke of the burden
         and glory that is freedom.</p>
      <p>When I visited this Chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington,
         critical of past policies which I believed had failed, I proposed a new
         spirit of partnership between this Congress and this administration and
         between Washington and our State and local governments. In forging this
         new partnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of our
         Republic--prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the
         blessings of individual liberty for our children and, someday, for all
         of humanity.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">It's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made
            in our relations with other nations, on the foundation we've carefully
            laid for our economic recovery, and finally, on a bold and spirited
            initiative that I believe can change the face of American government and
            make it again the servant of the people.</span></p>
      <p>Seldom have the stakes been higher for America. What we do and say here
         will make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit, lumberjacks in
         the Northwest, steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment
         lines; to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago; to hard-pressed farmers
         and small businessmen; and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor
         the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their
         children. To understand the state of the Union, we must look not only at
         where we are and where we're going but where we've been. The situation
         at this time last year was truly ominous.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The last decade has seen a series of recessions. There was a recession
            in 1970, in 1974, and again in the spring of 1980. Each time,
            unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again. We coined the
            word "stagflation" to describe this.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Government's response to these recessions was to pump up the money
            supply and increase spending. In the last 6 months of 1980, as an
            example, the money supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar
            history--13 percent. Inflation remained in double digits, and government
            spending increased at an annual rate of 17 percent. Interest rates
            reached a staggering 21.5 percent. There were 8 million unemployed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Late in 1981 we sank into the present recession, largely because
            continued high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction.
            And there was a drop in productivity, and the already high unemployment
            increased.</span></p>
      <p>This time, however, things are different. <span class="economy">We have an economic program in
            place, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past.
            It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending,
            and already that rate has been cut nearly in half. But reduced spending
            the first and smallest phase of a 3-year tax rate reduction designed to
            stimulate the economy and create jobs. Already interest rates are down
            to 15 3/4 percent, but they must still go lower. Inflation is down from
            12.4 percent to 8.9, and for the month of December it was running at an
            annualized rate of 5.2 percent.</span> If we had not acted as we did, things
         would be far worse for all Americans than they are today. Inflation,
         taxes, and interest rates would all be higher.</p>
      <p>A year ago, Americans' faith in their governmental process was steadily
         declining. Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic
         about their future. A new kind of defeatism was heard. Some said our
         domestic problems were uncontrollable, <span class="economy">that we had to learn to live with
            this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment.</span></p>
      <p>There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between
         our administration and this Congress. It was said we could never work
         together. Well, those predictions were wrong. The record is clear, and I
         believe that history will remember this as an era of American renewal,
         remember this administration as an administration of change, and
         remember this Congress as a Congress of destiny.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Together, we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in
            half, we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweeping
            changes in our tax structure since the beginning of this century. </span>And
         because we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation, we took away
         government's built-in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to
         grow larger at the expense of American workers.</p>
      <p>Together, after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the
         people in their States and local communities, we have started returning
         power and resources to them.</p>
      <p>Together, we have cut the growth of new Federal regulations nearly in
         half. In 1981 there were 23,000 fewer pages in the Federal Register,
         which lists new regulations, than there were in 1980. By deregulating
         oil we've come closer to achieving energy independence and helped bring
         down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Together, we have created an effective Federal strike force to combat
            waste and fraud in government. In just 6 months it has saved the
            taxpayers more than $2 billion, and it's only getting started</span>.</p>
      <p>Together we've begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicate
         wasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands of
         Americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America's social
         problems.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Together we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that
            ensures peace. Our country's uniform is being worn once again with
            pride.</span></p>
      <p>Together we have made a New Beginning, but we have only begun.</p>
      <p>No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy. In my Inaugural Address
         last year, I warned that the "ills we suffer have come upon us over
         several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but
         they will go away . . . because we as Americans have the capacity now,
         as we've had it in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve
         this last and greatest bastion of freedom."</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The economy will face difficult moments in the months ahead. But the
            program for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out
            of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by
            the latter half of this year.</span> And that is why I can report to you
         tonight that in the near future the state of the Union and the economy
         will be better--much better--if we summon the strength to continue on
         the course that we've charted.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">And so, the question: If the fundamentals are in place, what now? Well,
            two things. First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to
            the economy.</span> Our current problems are not the product of the recovery
         program that's only just now getting underway, as some would have you
         believe; they are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend
         and spend.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not
            respond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully
            integrated plan for recovery.</span> That plan is based on four commonsense
         fundamentals: continued reduction of the growth in Federal spending;
         preserving the individual and business tax reductions that will
         stimulate saving and investment; removing unnecessary Federal
         regulations to spark productivity; and maintaining a healthy dollar and
         a stable monetary policy, the latter a responsibility of the Federal
         Reserve System.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return
            to the policies that gave us a trillion-dollar debt, runaway inflation,
            runaway interest rates and unemployment.</span> The doubters would have us turn
         back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax
         rate reductions already passed by this Congress. Raise present taxes to
         cut future deficits, they tell us. Well, I don't believe we should buy
         that argument.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or
            surpluses several years ahead with any degree of accuracy. The budget in
            place, when I took office, had been projected as balanced. It turned out
            to have one of the biggest deficits in history. Another example of the
            imponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable--a
            change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit
            up or down by some $25 billion.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">As it now stands, our forecast, which we're required by law to make,
            will show major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars
            and declining, but still too high. More important, we're making progress
            with the three keys to reducing deficits: economic growth, lower
            interest rates, and spending control.</span> The policies we have in place will
         reduce the deficit steadily, surely, and in time, completely.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits. If they did, how would we
            explain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976; yet in that
            same 6-year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history.
            In 1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion, and in 1980 we had one of
            our all-time biggest deficits. Raising taxes won't balance the budget;
            it will encourage more government spending and less private investment.
            Raising taxes will slow economic growth, reduce production, and destroy
            future jobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find
            them and more likely that those who now have jobs could lose them.</span> So, I
         will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the backs of the
         American taxpayers.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I will seek no tax increases this year, and I have no intention of
            retreating from our basic program of tax relief.</span> I promise to bring the
         American people--to bring their tax rates down and to keep them down, to
         provide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in
         America's future. I will stand by my word. Tonight I'm urging the
         American people: Seize these new opportunities to produce, to save, to
         invest, and together we'll make this economy a mighty engine of freedom,
         hope, and prosperity again.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations.
            The recession did that. It lowered revenues and increased costs. To some
            extent, we're also victims of our own success. We've brought inflation
            down faster than we thought we could, and in doing this, we've deprived
            government of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes
            people into higher income tax brackets. And the continued high interest
            rates last year cost the government about $5 billion more than
            anticipated.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more
            waste, and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of
            employees in the Federal work force by 75,000.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major
            savings by dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education and by
            eliminating ineffective subsidies for business.</span> <span class="war">We'll continue to
            redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities--a strong
            national defense to keep America free and at peace and a reliable safety
            net of social programs for those who have contributed and those who are
            in need.</span></p>
      <p>Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this
         administration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly
         or America's poor. Under the new budget, funding for social insurance
         programs will be more than double the amount spent only 6 years ago. But
         it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made
         more efficient and economical.</p>
      <p>The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy
         have worthy goals and many deserving recipients. We will protect them.
         But there's only one way to see to it that these programs really help
         those whom they were designed to help. And that is to bring their
         spiraling costs under control.</p>
      <p>Today we face the absurd situation of a Federal budget with
         three-quarters of its expenditures routinely referred to as
         "uncontrollable." And a large part of this goes to entitlement programs.</p>
      <p>Committee after committee of this Congress has heard witness after
         witness describe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife
         with waste and fraud. Virtually every American who shops in a local
         supermarket is aware of the daily abuses that take place in the food
         stamp program, which has grown by 16,000 percent in the last 15 years.
         Another example is Medicare and Medicaid--programs with worthy goals but
         whose costs have increased from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion, more
         than 5 times as much, in just 10 years.</p>
      <p>Waste and fraud are serious problems. Back in 1980 Federal investigators
         testified before one of your committees that "corruption has permeated
         virtually every area of the Medicare and Medicaid health care industry."
         One official said many of the people who are cheating the system were
         "very confident that nothing was going to happen to them." Well,
         something is going to happen. Not only the taxpayers are defrauded; the
         people with real dependency on these programs are deprived of what they
         need, because available resources are going not to the needy, but to the
         greedy.</p>
      <p>The time has come to control the uncontrollable. In August we made a
         start. I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44
         billion over the next 3 years while at the same time preserving
         essential services for the truly needy. Shortly you will receive from me
         a message on further reforms we intend to install--some new, but others
         long recommended by your own congressional committees. I ask you to help
         make these savings for the American taxpayer.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some $63
            billion over 4 Years and will, without affecting social t security, go a
            long way toward bringing Federal spending under control.</span></p>
      <p>But don't be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will
         deprive the elderly, the needy, and the helpless.<span class="economy"> The. Federal
            Government will still subsidize 95 million meals every day. That's one
            out of seven of all the meals served in America. Head Start, senior
            nutrition programs, and child welfare programs will not be cut from the
            levels we proposed last year. More than one-half billion dollars has
            been proposed for minority business assistance. And research at the
            National Institute of Health will be increased by over $100 million.
            While meeting all these needs, we intend to plug unwarranted tax
            loopholes and strengthen the law which requires all large corporations
            to pay a minimum tax.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I am confident the economic program we've put into operation will
            protect the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all
            Americans. It will stimulate the economy, result in increased savings
            and provide capital for expansion, mortgages for homebuilding, <span class="poverty">and jobs
               for the unemployed.</span></span></p>
      <p>Now that the essentials of that program are in place, our next major
         undertaking must be a program--just as bold, just as innovative--to make
         government again accountable to the people, to make our system of
         federalism work again.</p>
      <p>Our citizens feel they've lost control of even the most basic decisions
         made about the essential services of government, such as schools,
         welfare, roads, and even garbage collection. And they're right. A maze
         of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average
         citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems. They don't
         know where to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise,
         who to blame, who to vote for or against. The main reason for this is
         the overpowering growth of Federal grants-in-aid programs during the
         past few decades.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In 1960 the Federal Government had 132 categorical grant programs,
            costing $7 billion. When I took office, there were approximately 500,
            costing nearly a hundred billion dollars--13 programs for energy, 36 for
            pollution control, 66 for social services, 90 for education. And here in
            the Congress, it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track
            of them.</span></p>
      <p>You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can
         properly oversee this jungle of grants-in-aid; indeed, the growth of
         these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of
         government. As one Democratic Governor put it recently: The National
         Government should be worrying about "arms control, not potholes."</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The growth in these Federal programs has--in the words of one
            intergovernmental commission--made the Federal Government "more
            pervasive, more intrusive, more unmanageable, more ineffective and
            costly, and above all, more (un) accountable." Let's solve this problem
            with a single, bold stroke: the return of some $47 billion in Federal
            programs to State and local government, together with the means to
            finance them and a transition period of nearly 10 years to avoid
            unnecessary disruption.</span></p>
      <p>I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program. I
         want to emphasize, however, that its full details will have been worked
         out only after close consultation with congressional, State, and local
         officials.</p>
      <p>Starting in fiscal 1984, the Federal Government will assume full
         responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to
         go along with its existing responsibility for Medicare. As part of a
         financially equal swap, the States will simultaneously take full
         responsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food
         stamps. This will make welfare less costly and more responsive to
         genuine need, because it'll be designed and administered closer to the
         grass roots and the people it serves.</p>
      <p>In 1984 the Federal Government will apply the full proceeds from certain
         excise taxes to a grass roots trust fund that will belong in fair shares
         to the 50 States. The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28
         billion a year. Over the next 4 years the States can use this money in
         either of two ways. If they want to continue receiving Federal grants in
         such areas as transportation, education, and social services, they can
         use their trust fund money to pay for the grants. Or to the extent they
         choose to forgo the Federal grant programs, they can use their trust
         fund money on their own for those or other purposes. There will be a
         mandatory pass-through of part of these funds to local governments.</p>
      <p>By 1988 the States will be in complete control of over 40 Federal grant
         programs. The trust fund will start to phase out, eventually to
         disappear, and the excise taxes will be turned over to the States. They
         can then preserve, lower, or raise taxes on their own and fund and
         manage these programs as they see fit.</p>
      <p>In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end
         cumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the Federal level while
         we ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people
         they're meant to help and the people who pay for them.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and
            flexibility of State and local governments, we're proposing legislation
            for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban
            areas in the 1980's and '90's.</span> This legislation will permit States and
         localities to apply to the Federal Government for designation as urban
         enterprise zones. A broad range of special economic incentives in the
         zones will help attract new business, new jobs, new opportunity to
         America's inner cities and rural towns. Some will say our mission is to
         save free enterprise. Well, I say we must free enterprise so that
         together we can save America.</p>
      <p>Some will also say our States and local communities are not up to the
         challenge of a new and creative partnership. <span class="civil-rights">Well, that might have been
            true 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the Voting
            Rights Act, the 10-year extension of which I strongly support. It's no
            longer true today. </span>This administration has faith in State and local
         governments and the constitutional balance envisioned by the Founding
         Fathers. We also believe in the integrity, decency, and sound, good
         sense of grass roots Americans.</p>
      <p>Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.
         Our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful
         community models of school, church, business, union, foundation, and
         civic programs that help community needs. Such groups are almost
         invariably far more efficient than government in running social
         programs.</p>
      <p>We're not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited
         government programs dollar for dollar, service for service. We just want
         to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to
         profit by their example. Three hundred and eighty-five thousand
         corporations and private organizations are already working on social
         programs ranging from drug rehabilitation to job training, and thousands
         more Americans have written us asking how they can help. The volunteer
         spirit is still alive and well in America.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Our nation's long journey towards civil rights for all our
            citizens--once a source of discord, now a source of pride--must continue
            with no backsliding or slowing down. We must and shall see that those
            basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and, when
            necessary, strengthened.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable. We
            launched a new Task Force on Legal Equity for Women and a Fifty States
            Project that will examine State laws for discriminatory language.</span> And
         for the first time in our history, a woman sits on the highest court in
         the land.</p>
      <p>So, too, the problem of crime--one as real and deadly serious as any in
         America today. It demands that we seek transformation of our legal
         system, which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves
         society and the innocent victims of crime without justice.</p>
      <p>We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to
         increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air. We're
         encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of
         further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations.</p>
      <p>So far, I've concentrated largely, now, on domestic matters. To view the
         state of the Union in perspective, we must not ignore the rest of the
         world. There isn't time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social--or
         foreign policy, I should say, a subject I intend to address in detail in
         the near future. A few words, however, are in order on the progress
         we've made over the past year, reestablishing respect for our nation
         around the globe and some of the challenges and goals that we will
         approach in the year ahead.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">At Ottawa and Cancun, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers
            and developing nations. Now, some of those I met with were a little
            surprised that I didn't apologize for America's wealth. Instead, I spoke
            of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could
            help them realize their aspirations for economic development and
            political freedom.</span> I believe lasting friendships were made, and the
         foundation was laid for future cooperation.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the vital region of the Caribbean Basin, we're developing a program
            of aid, trade, and investment incentives to promote self-sustaining
            growth and a better, more secure life for our neighbors to the south.
            Toward those who would export terrorism and subversion in the Caribbean
            and elsewhere, especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness, and balance. By
            restoring America's military credibility, by pursuing peace at the
            negotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good
            faith, and by regaining the respect of America's allies and adversaries
            alike, we have strengthened our country's position as a force for peace
            and progress in the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">When action is called for, we're taking it. Our sanctions against the
            military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in
            Poland--and against the Soviet regime behind that military
            dictatorship--clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not
            conduct "business as usual" with the forces of oppression.</span> If the events
         in Poland continue to deteriorate, further measures will follow.</p>
      <p>Now, let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead
         in making January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland.
         So, too, the European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an
         international day of support for Afghanistan. Well, I urge all
         peace-loving peoples to join together on those days, to raise their
         voices, to speak and pray for freedom.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities,
         as I announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th. <span class="war">We have
            proposed to the Soviet Union a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction
            of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in
            Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces.</span> In those talks it is
         essential that we negotiate from a position of strength. There must be a
         real incentive for the Soviets to take these talks seriously. This
         requires that we rebuild our defenses.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In the last decade, while we sought the moderation of Soviet power
            through a process of restraint and accommodation, the Soviets engaged in
            an unrelenting buildup of their military forces.</span> The protection of our
         national security has required that we undertake a substantial program
         to enhance our military forces.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe
            and Asia, or to develop key relationships with our partners in the
            Middle East and other countries. Building a more peaceful world requires
            a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up.</span> When radical
         forces threaten our friends, when economic misfortune creates conditions
         of instability, when strategically vital parts of the world fall under
         the shadow of Soviet power, our response can make the difference between
         peaceful change or disorder and violence. That's why we've laid such
         stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance
         program. Your recent passage of the Foreign Assistance Act sent a signal
         to the world that America will not shrink from making the investments
         necessary for both peace and security. Our foreign policy must be rooted
         in realism, not naivete or self-delusion.</p>
      <p>A recognition of what the Soviet empire is about is the starting point.
         Winston Churchill, in negotiating with the Soviets, observed that they
         respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations.
         That's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses. We intend
         to keep the peace. We will also keep our freedom.</p>
      <p>We have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements and
         worldwide broadcasts. In the face of a climate of falsehood and
         misinformation, we've promised the world a season of truth--the truth of
         our great civilized ideas: individual liberty, representative
         government, the rule of law under God. We've never needed walls or
         minefields or barbed wire to keep our people in. Nor do we declare
         martial law to keep our people from voting for the kind of government
         they want.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Yes, we have our problems; yes, we're in a time of recession. And it's
            true, there's no quick fix, as I said, to instantly end the tragic pain
            of unemployment. But we will end it.</span> The process has already begun, and
         we'll see its effect as the year goes on.</p>
      <p>We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who
         overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago.
         But our glory didn't end with them. Americans ever since have emulated
         their deeds.</p>
      <p>We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They're all
         around us. One who sits among you here tonight epitomized that heroism
         at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our
         Armed Forces. Who will ever forget that night when we waited for
         television to bring us the scene of that first plane landing at Clark
         Field in the Philippines, bringing our POW's home? The plane door opened
         and Jeremiah Denton came slowly down the ramp. He caught sight of our
         flag, saluted it, said, "God bless America," and then thanked us for
         bringing him home.</p>
      <p>Just 2 weeks ago, in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac, we
         saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest--the heroism of
         dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters. And we
         saw the heroism of one of our young government employees, Lenny Skutnik,
         who, when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line, dived
         into the water and dragged her to safety.</p>
      <p>And then there are countless, quiet, everyday heroes of American who
         sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than
         they've known; church and civic volunteers who help to feed, clothe,
         nurse, and teach the needy; millions who've made our nation and our
         nation's destiny so very special--unsung heroes who may not have
         realized their own dreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams
         in their children. Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days
         are behind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished. We've seen
         it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing in it now.</p>
      <p>A hundred and twenty years ago, the greatest of all our Presidents
         delivered his second State of the Union message in this Chamber. "We
         cannot escape history," Abraham Lincoln warned. "We of this Congress and
         this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves." The
         "trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor,
         to the latest (last) generation."</p>
      <p>Well, that President and that Congress did not fail the American people.
         Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union. Let it be
         said of us that we, too, did not fail; that we, too, worked together to
         bring America through difficult times. Let us so conduct ourselves that
         two centuries from now, another Congress and another President, meeting
         in this Chamber as we are meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying
         that we met the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred
         flame of liberty--this last, best hope of man on Earth.</p>
      <p>God bless you, and thank you.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The President spoke at 9 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol.
         He was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of
         Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and
         television.

      <h3>January 25, 1983</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress,
         honored guests, and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>This solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a President of the United
         States has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington
         first did so in 1790. That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage
         of new things to say about the State of the Union. The very key to our
         success has been our ability, foremost among nations, to preserve our
         lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us.</p>
      <p>I would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do
         together--not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans--to make
         tomorrow's America happy and prosperous at home, strong and respected
         abroad, and at peace in the world.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">As we gather here tonight, the state of our Union is strong, but our
            economy is troubled.</span> <span class="poverty">For too many of our fellow citizens--farmers, steel
            and auto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers--this is a
            painful period.</span> We must all do everything in our power to bring their
         ordeal to an end. It has fallen to us, in our time, to undo damage that
         was a long time in the making, and to begin the hard but necessary task
         of building a better future for ourselves and our children.</p>
      <p>We have a long way to go, but thanks to the courage, patience, and
         strength of our people, America is on the mend.</p>
      <p>But let me give you just one important reason why I believe this--it
         involves many members of this body.</p>
      <p>Just 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisan
         Commission on Social Security accomplished the seemingly impossible.
         Social security, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster.
         I, myself, have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years. As
         1983 began, the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim
         of our economic ills. <span class="economy">First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its
            reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of
            living. Then the recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the
            expanding wage base and increasing revenues the system needs to support
            the 36 million Americans who depend on it.</span></p>
      <p>When the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and I
         performed the bipartisan--or formed the bipartisan Commission on Social
         Security, pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and
         conflicting interests would prevent the Commission from agreeing on a
         plan to save social security. Well, sometimes, even here in Washington,
         the cynics are wrong. Through compromise and cooperation, the members of
         the Commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair, workable
         plan. They proved that, when it comes to the national welfare, Americans
         can still pull together for the common good.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I'm especially pleased to join with the Speaker and the Senate
         majority leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter.</p>
      <p>There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken
         together it performs a package that all of us can support. It asks for
         some sacrifice by all--the self-employed, beneficiaries, workers,
         government employees, and the better-off among the retired--but it
         imposes an undue burden on none. And, in supporting it, we keep an
         important pledge to the American people: The integrity of the social
         security system will be preserved, and no one's payments will be
         reduced.</p>
      <p>The Commission's plan will do the job; indeed, it must do the job. We
         owe it to today's older Americans and today's younger workers. So,
         before we go any further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the
         members of the Commission who are here tonight and Senate Majority
         Leader Howard Baker and Speaker Tip O'Neill for a job well done. I hope
         and pray the bipartisan spirit that guided you in this endeavor will
         inspire all of us as we face the challenges of the year ahead.</p>
      <p>Nearly half a century ago, in this Chamber, another American President,
         Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his second State of the Union message,
         urged America to look to the future, to meet the challenge of change and
         the need for leadership that looks forward, not backward.</p>
      <p>"Throughout the world," he said, "change is the order of the day. In
         every nation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to
         (of) many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were
         unprepared." He also reminded us that "the future lies with those wise
         political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more
         in Government than in politics."</p>
      <p>So, let us, in these next 2 years--men and women of both parties, every
         political shade--concentrate on the long-range, bipartisan
         responsibilities of government, not the short-range or short-term
         temptations of partisan politics.</p>
      <p>The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of
         government had expected; the recession was deeper than most inside and
         out of government had predicted. Curing those problems has taken more
         time and a higher toll than any of us wanted. Unemployment is far too
         high. Projected Federal spending--if government refuses to tighten its
         own belt--will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the
         economic recovery now underway.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and
            spending for consumer items and capital goods--the stimulus we need to
            restart our stalled economic engines.</span> The American people have already
         stepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed to
         modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow
         to business and industry.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The inflationary expectations that led to a 21 1/2-percent interest
            prime rate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by
            almost half. Leaders have started to realize that double-digit inflation
            is no longer a way of life.</span> I misspoke there. I should have said
         "lenders."</p>
      <p><span class="economy">So, interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital
            industries like housing and autos.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in. Housing
            starts for the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year
            ago, and housing permits, a sure indicator of future growth, were up a
            whopping 60 percent.</span></p>
      <p>We're witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that
         American industry will once again become competitive in markets at home
         and abroad, ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the Nation's work
         force. But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience.
         Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades
         are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such
         a heavy price to cure.</p>
      <p>The permanent recovery in employment, production, and investment we seek
         won't come in a sharp, short spurt. It'll build carefully and steadily
         in the months and years ahead. <span class="economy">In the meantime, the challenge of
            government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the
            massive economic transition for the American people.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The Federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic
            problems. Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government
            spending, we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into
            the indefinite future.</span> Failure to cope with this problem now could mean
         as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next 4 years
         alone. That would average $4,300 in additional debt for every man,
         woman, child, and baby in our nation.</p>
      <p>To assure a sustained recovery, we must continue getting runaway
         spending under control to bring those deficits down. If we don't, the
         recovery will be too short, unemployment will remain too high, and we
         will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children.
         That we must not do.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from. Contrary to
            the drumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we
            face are not rooted in defense spending. Taken as a percentage of the
            gross national product, our defense spending happens to be only about
            four-fifths of what it was in 1970. Nor is the deficit, as some would
            have it, rooted in tax cuts. Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction
            of gross national product remain about the same as they were in 1970.</span>
         The fact is, our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the
         budget for domestic spending.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">During the 1970's, the share of our national income devoted to this
            domestic spending increased by more than 60 percent, from 10 cents out
            of every dollar produced by the American people to 16 cents. In spite of
            all our economies and efficiencies, and without adding any new programs,
            basic, necessary domestic spending provided for in this year's budget
            will grow to almost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years.</span></p>
      <p>The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of
         our Republic. We need a plan to overcome this danger--a plan based on
         these principles. It must be bipartisan. Conquering the deficits and
         putting the Government's house in order will require the best effort of
         all of us. It must be fair. Just as all will share in the benefits that
         will come from recovery, all would share fairly in the burden of
         transition. It must be prudent. The strength of our national defense
         must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom
         while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy. And finally, it
         must be realistic. We can't rely on hope alone.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan
            to increase economic growth and reduce deficits.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, in my budget message, I will recommend a Federal spending freeze.
            I know this is strong medicine, but so far, we have only cut the rate of
            increase in Federal spending. The Government has continued to spend more
            money each year, though not as much more as it did in the past. Taken as
            a whole, the budget I'm proposing for the fiscal year will increase no
            more than the rate of inflation. In other words, the Federal Government
            will hold the line on real spending. Now, that's far less than many
            American families have had to do in these difficult times.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I will request that the proposed 6-month freeze in cost-of-living
            adjustments recommended by the bipartisan Social Security Commission be
            applied to other government-related retirement programs.</span> I will, also,
         propose a 1-year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs,
         and for Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs. And let
         me say right here, I'm sorry, with regard to the military, in asking
         that of them, because for so many years they have been so far behind and
         so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing. But
         I'm sure they will understand that this must be across the board and
         fair.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control
            the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs. These are
            the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be
            simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970. They
            are the largest single cause of the built-in or structural deficit
            problem. Our standard here will be fairness, ensuring that the
            taxpayers' hard-earned dollars go only to the truly needy; that none of
            them are turned away, but that fraud and waste are stamped out.</span> And I'm
         sorry to say, there's a lot of it out there. In the food stamp program
         alone, last year, we identified almost $1.1 billion in overpayments. The
         taxpayers aren't the only victims of this kind of abuse. The truly needy
         suffer as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the
         greedy. For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and
         corruption.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by
            proposing $55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years.</span> <span class="war">These
            are savings recommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has
            assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability
            to negotiate arms reductions or endanger America's security. We will not
            gamble with our national survival.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And fourth, because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of
            deficits over the next several years, I will propose a standby tax,
            limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product, to
            start in fiscal 1986. It would last no more than 3 years, and it would
            start only if the Congress has first approved our spending freeze and
            budget control program.</span> And there are several other conditions also that
         must be met, all of them in order for this program to be triggered.</p>
      <p>Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a
         remedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely
         necessary. In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the
         tax code and make it more fair for all Americans. This is a goal that
         every American who's ever struggled with a tax form can understand.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic
            tax reforms that we've already enacted, including the 10-percent tax
            break coming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing which will
            protect all Americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years
            ahead.</span></p>
      <p>Now, I realize that this four-part plan is easier to describe than it
         will be to enact. But the looming deficits that hang over us and over
         America's future must be reduced. The path I've outlined is fair,
         balanced, and realistic. If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in
         deficits, aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade. It's
         the only path that will lead to a strong, sustained recovery. Let us
         follow that path together.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent
            jobs for all Americans who want to work. The recovery program will
            provide jobs for most, but others will need special help and training
            for new skills.</span> Shortly, I will submit to the Congress the Employment
         Act of 1983, designed to get at the special problems of the long-term
         unemployed, as well as young people trying to enter the job market. I'll
         propose extending unemployment benefits, including special incentives to
         employers who hire the long-term unemployed, providing programs for
         displaced workers, and helping federally funded and State-administered
         unemployment insurance programs provide workers with training and
         relocation assistance. Finally, our proposal will include new incentives
         for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job
         market.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our
            unemployed.</span> I hope we can work together on this. I hope we can work
         together as we did last year in enacting the landmark Job Training
         Partnership Act. Regulatory reform legislation, a responsible clean air
         act, and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new
         incentives for jobs and opportunity.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">One of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade. So, I
            will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade--one
            that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to
            America's farmers and workers in the world marketplace. We must have
            adequate export financing to sell American products overseas. I will ask
            for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our
            products into foreign markets.</span> We must strengthen the organization of
         our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and
         international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow
         of American goods, services, and investments.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our trade position can also be improved by making our port system more
            efficient. Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our
            coalfields, railroads, trucking industry, and ports. After 2 years of
            debate, it's time for us to get together and enact a port modernization
            bill</span>.</p>
      <p>Education, training, and retraining are fundamental to our success as
         are research and development and productivity. Labor, management, and
         government at all levels can and must participate in improving these
         tools of growth. <span class="infra">Tax policy, regulatory practices, and government
            programs all need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness.
            Every American has a role and a stake in international trade.</span></p>
      <p>We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields. We must
         keep that edge, and to do so we need to begin renewing the
         basics--starting with our educational system. While we grew complacent,
         others have acted. Japan, with a population only about half the size of
         ours, graduates from its universities more engineers than we do. If a
         child doesn't receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of
         16, he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer. We
         must join together--parents, teachers, grass roots groups, organized
         labor, and the business community--to revitalize American education by
         setting a standard of excellence.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In 1983 we seek four major education goals: a quality education
            initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science
            instruction through block grants to the States; establishment of
            education savings accounts that will give middle and lower-income
            families an incentive to save for their children's college education
            and, at the same time, encourage a real increase in savings for economic
            growth; passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send
            their children to private or religiously affiliated schools; a
            constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer. God should
            never have been expelled from America's classrooms in the first place.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="civil-rights">Our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic
               equity for women, and eliminate, once and for all, all traces of unjust
               discrimination against women from the United States Code.</span> We will not
            tolerate wage discrimination based on sex, and we intend to strengthen
            enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents, most of
            whom are women, do not suffer unfair financial hardship. We will also
            take action to remedy inequities in pensions. These initiatives will be
            joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Also in the area of fairness and equity, we will ask for extension of
            the Civil Rights Commission, which is due to expire this year. The
            Commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in
            America, and we strongly support its reauthorization. </span>Effective
         enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to
         ensuring equal opportunity. In the year ahead, we'll work to strengthen
         enforcement of fair housing laws for all Americans.</p>
      <p>The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes
         and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug
         trafficking. It's high time that we make our cities safe again. This
         administration hereby declares an all-out war on big-time organized
         crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people. We
         will also implement recommendations of our Task Force on Victims of
         Crime, which will report to me this week.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">American agriculture, the envy of the world, has become the victim of
            its own successes. With one farmer now producing enough food to feed
            himself and 77 other people, America is confronted with record surplus
            crops and commodity prices below the cost of production. </span>We must strive,
         through innovations like the payment-in-kind crop swap approach and an
         aggressive export policy, to restore health and vitality to rural
         America. Meanwhile, I have instructed the Department of Agriculture to
         work individually with farmers with debt problems to help them through
         these tough times.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, our Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives has
         successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business,
         labor, education, and government to address the training needs of
         American workers. <span class="economy">Thanks to the Task Force, private sector initiatives
            are now underway in all 50 States of the Union, and thousands of working
            people have been helped in making the shift from dead-end jobs and
            low-demand skills to the growth areas of high technology and the service
            economy.</span> Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the
         expansion of private community child care. The new advisory council on
         private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of
         encouraging private initiative in 1983.</p>
      <p>In the coming year, we will also act to improve the quality of life for
         Americans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is
         becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many. And we will submit
         legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older
         Americans.</p>
      <p>I will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will
         continue our efforts to restore to States and local governments their
         roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.</p>
      <p>During the next several weeks, I will send to the Congress a series of
         detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working
         with you on the development of these initiatives.</p>
      <p>So far, now, I've concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the
         future. <span class="infra">But in almost every home and workplace in America, we're already
            witnessing reason for great hope--the first flowering of the manmade
            miracles of high technology, a field pioneered and still led by our
            country.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">To many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing,
            cybernetics, and all the other innovations of the dawning high
            technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion
            engine must have been when that first Model T rattled down Main Street,
            U.S.A.</span> But as surely as America's pioneer spirit made us the industrial
         giant of the 20th century, the same pioneer spirit today is opening up
         on another vast front of opportunity, the frontier of high technology.</p>
      <p>In conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional
         industries, but we must develop the skills and industries that will make
         us a pioneer of tomorrow. This administration is committed to keeping
         America the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st
         century.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But let us turn briefly to the international arena. America's leadership
            in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the
            values which guide us as a society: free elections, a free press,
            freedom of religious choice, free trade unions, and above all, freedom
            for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state.</span>
         These values are the bedrock of our strength. They unite us in a
         stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in
         Asia, in Latin America, and elsewhere. They are also the values which in
         the recent past some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical
         eye.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Fortunately, we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our
            common democratic values, and we're applying them as a cornerstone of a
            comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom. In London last year, I
            announced the commitment of the United States to developing the
            infrastructure of democracy throughout the world. We intend to pursue
            this democratic initiative vigorously.</span> The future belongs not to
         governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples, but to
         democratic systems of self-government which encourage individual
         initiative and guarantee personal freedom.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">But our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on
               strength--economic strength and military strength. A strong American
               economy is essential to the well-being and security of our friends and
               allies. The restoration of a strong, healthy American economy has been
               and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy.</span></span> The
         progress I've been able to report to you tonight will, I know, be as
         warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the American
         people.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably
            linked to the world economy. We export over 20 percent of our industrial
            production, and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export. We will
            continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of Europe
            and Japan and with the International Monetary Fund to ensure it has
            adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong,
            noninflationary growth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">As the leader of the West and as a country that has become great and
            rich because of economic freedom, America must be an unrelenting
            advocate of free trade</span>. As some nations are tempted to turn to
         protectionism, our strategy cannot be to follow them, but to lead the
         way toward freer trade. To this end, in May of this year America will
         host an economic summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia.</p>
      <p><span class="war">As we begin our third year, we have put in place a defense program that
            redeems the neglect of the past decade. We have developed a realistic
            military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if
            deterrence fails. Our Armed Forces are finally properly paid; after
            years of neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and
            supplied.</span> And the American uniform is once again worn with pride. Most
         of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already
         underway, and we will be addressing one key system, the MX missile, in
         consultation with the Congress in a few months.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">America's foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on
            realism, strength, full partnership, in consultation with our allies,
            and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries. From the Middle
            East to southern Africa to Geneva, American diplomats are taking the
            initiative to make peace and lower arms levels. We should be proud of
            our role as peacemakers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role in
            ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of
            the PLO from Beirut.</span></p>
      <p>Last September, I outlined principles to carry on the peace process
         begun so promisingly at Camp David. All the people of the Middle East
         should know that in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to
         build on that foundation to bring them the blessings of peace.</p>
      <p>In Central America and the Caribbean Basin, we are likewise engaged in a
         partnership for peace, prosperity, and democracy. Final passage of the
         remaining portions of our Caribbean Basin Initiative, which passed the
         House last year, is one of this administration's top legislative
         priorities for 1983.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">The security and economic assistance policies of this administration in
               Latin America and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a
               critical investment in the future of the human race.</span> This undertaking is
            a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches, and
            I'm counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the Congress to
            help us meet this essential foreign policy goal.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the
            Soviet Union. The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership. We're
            prepared for a positive change in Soviet-American relations. But the
            Soviet Union must show by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to
            respect the rights and sovereignty of the family of nations. Responsible
            members of the world community do not threaten or invade their
            neighbors. And they restrain their allies from aggression.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">For our part, we're vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with
            the Soviet Union. Supported by our allies, we've put forward draft
            agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and
            verifiable lower levels.</span> We insist on an equal balance of forces. And
         given the overwhelming evidence of Soviet violations of international
         treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons, we also insist that
         any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In the case of intermediate-range nuclear forces, we have proposed the
            complete elimination of the entire class of land-based missiles. We're
            also prepared to carefully explore serious Soviet proposals. At the same
            time, let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to
            achieving arms reductions.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">With firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate. Deep down,
            the Soviets must know it's in their interest as well as ours to prevent
            a wasteful arms race.</span> And once they recognize our unshakable resolve to
         maintain adequate deterrence, they will have every reason to join us in
         the search for greater security and major arms reductions. When that
         moment comes--and I'm confident that it will--we will have taken an
         important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world's people.</p>
      <p>A very wise man, Bernard Baruch, once said that America has never
         forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light
         her path. Our country is a special place, because we Americans have
         always been sustained, through good times and bad, by a noble vision--a
         vision not only of what the world around us is today but what we as a
         free people can make it be tomorrow.</p>
      <p>We're realists; we solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no
         matter how loud the chorus of despair around us. But we're also
         idealists, for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these
         shores from every corner of the world.</p>
      <p>Right now we need both realism and idealism. <span class="poverty">Millions of our neighbors
            are without work.</span> It is up to us to see they aren't without hope. This
         is a task for all of us. And may I say, Americans have rallied to this
         cause, proving once again that we are the most generous people on Earth.</p>
      <p>We who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy.
         And here all that time, I thought you were reading the paper.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The single thing--the single thing that can start the wheels of industry
            turning again is further reduction of interest rates. Just another 1 or
            2 points can mean tens of thousands of jobs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Right now, with inflation as low as it is, 3.9 percent, there is room
            for interest rates to come down. Only fear prevents their reduction.</span> A
         lender, as we know, must charge an interest rate that recovers the
         depreciated value of the dollars loaned. And that depreciation is, of
         course, the amount of inflation. Today, interest rates are based on
         fear--fear that government will resort to measures, as it has in the
         past, that will send inflation zooming again.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We who serve here in this Capital must erase that fear by making it
            absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation; that,
            together, we will do only those things that will lead to lasting
            economic growth.</span></p>
      <p>Yes, the problems confronting us are large and forbidding. And,
         certainly, no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our
         friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of
         unemployment. But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful.</p>
      <p>Back over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these
         walls when our nation was threatened; sometimes when its very existence
         was at stake. Always with courage and common sense, they met the crises
         of their time and lived to see a stronger, better, and more prosperous
         country. The present situation is no worse and, in fact, is not as bad
         as some of those they faced. Time and again, they proved that there is
         nothing we Americans cannot achieve as free men and women.</p>
      <p>Yes, we still have problems--plenty of them. But it's just plain
         wrong--unjust to our country and unjust to our people--to let those
         problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all: America is
         on the mend.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help
               them in every way we can. No one can quarrel with that. We must and do
               have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis.</span></span> But the big
         story about America today is the way that millions of confident, caring
         people--those extraordinary "ordinary" Americans who never make the
         headlines and will never be interviewed--are laying the foundation, not
         just for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow
         for all our people.</p>
      <p>From coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories, at
         new construction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors
         are helping neighbors. And they've already begun the building, the
         research, the work, and the giving that will make our country great
         again.</p>
      <p>I believe this, because I believe in them--in the strength of their
         hearts and minds, in the commitment that each one of them brings to
         their daily lives, be they high or humble. The challenge for us in
         government is to be worthy of them--to make government a help, not a
         hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising days ahead.</p>
      <p>If we do that, if we care what our children and our children's children
         will say of us, if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did
         here in these temples of freedom, we will work together to make America
         better for our having been here--not just in this year or this decade
         but in the next century and beyond.</p>
      <p>Thank you, and God bless you.</p>

      <h3>January 25, 1984</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress,
         honored guests, and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>Once again, in keeping with time-honored tradition, I have come to
         report to you on the state of the Union, and I'm pleased to report that
         America is much improved, and there's good reason to believe that
         improvement will continue through the days to come.</p>
      <p>You and I have had some honest and open differences in the year past.
         But they didn't keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to
         stop a long decline that had drained this nation's spirit and eroded its
         health. There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land.
         America is back, standing tall, looking to the eighties with courage,
         confidence, and hope.</p>
      <p>The problems we're overcoming are not the heritage of one person, party,
         or even one generation. It's just the tendency of government to grow,
         for practices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life
         we'll ever see on this Earth. And there's always that well-intentioned
         chorus of voices saying, "With a little more power and a little more
         money, we could do so much for the people." For a time we forgot the
         American dream isn't one of making government bigger; it's keeping faith
         with the mighty spirit of free people under God.</p>
      <p>As we came to the decade of the eighties, we faced the worst crisis in
         our postwar history. In the seventies were years of rising problems and
         falling confidence. There was a feeling government had grown beyond the
         consent of the governed. Families felt helpless in the face of mounting
         inflation and the indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work,
         thrift, and risktaking. All this was overlaid by an evergrowing web of
         rules and regulations.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">On the international scene, we had an uncomfortable feeling that we'd
            lost the respect of friend and foe. Some questioned whether we had the
            will to defend peace and freedom.</span> But America is too great for small
         dreams. There was a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival; if you
         will, a crusade for renewal. The American people said: Let us look to
         the future with confidence, both at home and abroad. Let us give freedom
         a chance.</p>
      <p>Americans were ready to make a new beginning, and together we have done
         it. We're confronting our problems one by one. <span class="economy">Hope is alive tonight for
            millions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax
            increases and crushing inflation. Inflation has been beaten down from
            12.4 to 3.2 percent, and that's a great victory for all the people.</span> The
         prime rate has been cut almost in half, and we must work together to
         bring it down even more.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">&gt;Together, we passed the first across-the-board tax reduction for
            everyone since the Kennedy tax cuts. Next year, tax rates will be
            indexed so inflation can't push people into higher brackets when they
            get cost-of-living pay raises.</span> Government must never again use inflation
         to profit at the people's expense.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Today a working family earning $25,000 has $1,100 more in purchasing
            power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 levels.
            Real after-tax income increased 5 percent last year. And economic
            deregulation of key industries like transportation has offered more
            chances--or choices, I should say, to consumers and new changes--or
            chances for entrepreneurs and protecting safety.</span> Tonight, we can report
         and be proud of one of the best recoveries in decades. Send away the
         handwringers and the doubting Thomases. Hope is reborn for couples
         dreaming of owning homes and for risktakers with vision to create
         tomorrow's opportunities.</p>
      <p>The spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of
         high-tech and by small business people with big ideas--people like
         Barbara Proctor, who rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion-dollar
         advertising agency in Chicago; Carlos Perez, a Cuban refugee, who turned
         $27 and a dream into a successful importing business in Coral Gables,
         Florida.</p>
      <p>People like these are heroes for the eighties. They helped 4 million
         Americans find jobs in 1983. More people are drawing paychecks tonight
         than ever before. And Congress helps--or progress helps everyone--well,
         Congress does too----everyone. <span class="civil-rights">In 1983 women filled 73 percent of all
            the new jobs in managerial, professional, and technical fields.</span></p>
      <p>But we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work,
         wondering what will come of their hopes and dreams. Can we love America
         and not reach out to tell them: You are not forgotten; we will not rest
         until each of you can reach as high as your God-given talents will take
         you.</p>
      <p>The heart of America is strong; it's good and true. The cynics were
         wrong; America never was a sick society. We're seeing rededication to
         bedrock values of faith, family, work, neighborhood, peace, and
         freedom--values that help bring us together as one people, from the
         youngest child to the most senior citizen.</p>
      <p>The Congress deserves America's thanks for helping us restore pride and
         credibility to our military. And I hope that you're as proud as I am of
         the young men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the
         ramparts in defense of freedom and whose dedication, valor, and skill
         increases so much our chance of living in a world at peace.</p>
      <p>People everywhere hunger for peace and a better life. The tide of the
         future is a freedom tide, and our struggle for democracy cannot and will
         not be denied. This nation champions peace that enshrines liberty,
         democratic rights, and dignity for every individual. America's new
         strength, confidence, and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity far
         from our shores. <span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">A world economic recovery is underway. It began here.</span></span></p>
      <p>We've journeyed far, but we have much farther to go. Franklin Roosevelt
         told us 50 years ago this month: "Civilization can not go back;
         civilization must not stand still. We have undertaken new methods. It is
         our task to perfect, to improve, to alter when necessary, but in all
         cases to go forward."</p>
      <p>It's time to move forward again, time for America to take freedom's next
         step. Let us unite tonight behind four great goals to keep America free,
         secure, and at peace in the eighties together.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We can ensure steady economic growth.</span> We can develop America's next
         frontier. We can strengthen our traditional values. And we can build a
         meaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of
         faith that has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of
         freedom, progress, and hope.</p>
      <p>Doing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity, provide
         greater security for all, with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth, our first great
            goal. We might well begin with common sense in Federal budgeting:
            government spending no more than government takes in.</span></p>
      <p>We must bring Federal deficits down. But how we do that makes all the
         difference.</p>
      <p>We can begin by limiting the size and scope of government. <span class="economy">Under the
            leadership of Vice President Bush, we have reduced the growth of Federal
            regulations by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hours
            of government-required paperwork each year. This will save the public
            more than $150 billion over the next 10 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The Grace commission has given us some 2,500 recommendations for
            reducing wasteful spending, and they're being examined throughout the
            administration. Federal spending growth has been cut from 17.4 percent
            in 1980 to less than half of that today, and we have already achieved
            over $300 billion in budget savings for the period of 1982 to '86. But
            that's only a little more than half of what we sought. Government is
            still spending too large a percentage of the total economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Now, some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by
            reducing the portion spent on defense. This ignores the fact that
            national defense is solely the responsibility of the Federal Government;
            indeed, it is its prime responsibility. </span>And yet defense spending is less
         than a third of the total budget. During the years of President Kennedy
         and of the years before that, defense was almost half the total budget.
         And then came several years in which our military capability was allowed
         to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree. We are just now restoring,
         through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic
         forces, our capability to meet our present and future security needs. We
         dare not shirk our responsibility to keep America free, secure, and at
         peace.</p>
      <p>The last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control.
         But the basis for such spending had been laid in previous years. A
         pattern of overspending has been in place for half a century. As the
         national debt grew, we were told not to worry, that we owed it to
         ourselves.</p>
      <p>Now we know that deficits are a cause for worry. But there's a
         difference of opinion as to whether taxes should be increased, spending
         cut, or some of both. Fear is expressed that government borrowing to
         fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital
         needed for business and industrial expansion. Well, I think that debate
         is missing an important point. Whether government borrows or increases
         taxes, it will be taking the same amount of money from the private
         sector, and, either way, that's too much. Simple fairness dictates that
         government must not raise taxes on families struggling to pay their
         bills. The root of the problem is that government's share is more than
         we can afford if we're to have a sound economy.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth. In
            the budget that I will submit on February 1st, I will recommend measures
            that will reduce the deficit over the next 5 years.</span> Many of these will
         be unfinished business from last year's budget.</p>
      <p>Some could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort to
         address this problem. I spoke today with Speaker of the House O'Neill,
         Senate Majority Leader Baker, Senate Minority Leader Byrd, and House
         Minority Leader Michel. I asked them if they would designate
         congressional representatives to meet with representatives of the
         administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit
         reduction plan. I know it would take a long, hard struggle to agree on a
         full-scale plan. So, what I have proposed is that we first see if we can
         agree on a down payment.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, I believe there is basis for such an agreement, one that could
            reduce the deficits by about a hundred billion dollars over the next 3
            years. We could focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that
            are still pending before the Congress.</span> These could be combined with
         measures to close certain tax loopholes, measures that the Treasury
         Department has previously said to be worthy of support. In addition, we
         could examine the possibility of achieving further outlay savings based
         on the work of the Grace commission.</p>
      <p>If the congressional leadership is willing, my representatives will be
         prepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time. I would hope
         the leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop
         and enact that down payment.</p>
      <p>But a down payment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficit
         problem. It could help us start on the right path. Yet, we must do more.
         So, I propose that we begin exploring how together we can make
         structural reforms to curb the built-in growth of spending.</p>
      <p>I also propose improvements in the budgeting process. Some 43 of our 50
         States grant their Governors the right to veto individual items in
         appropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill. California
         is one of those 43 States. As Governor, I found this line-item veto was
         a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending. It works in 43
         States. Let's put it to work in Washington for all the people.</p>
      <p>It would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment. The
         majority of Americans approve of such an amendment, just as they and I
         approve of an amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget. Many States
         also have this protection in their constitutions.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a
            Band-Aid solution which does nothing to cure an illness that's been
            coming on for half a century--to say nothing of the fact that it poses a
            real threat to economic recovery.</span> Let's remember that a substantial
         amount of income tax is presently owed and not paid by people in the
         underground economy. It would be immoral to make those who are paying
         taxes pay more to compensate for those who aren't paying their share.</p>
      <p>There's a better way. Let us go forward with an historic reform for
         fairness, simplicity, and incentives for growth. I am asking Secretary
         Don Regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so all
         taxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly. And I believe such a
         plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the
         sunlight of honest tax compliance. And it could make the tax base
         broader, so personal tax rates could come down, not go up. I've asked
         that specific recommendations, consistent with those objectives, be
         presented to me by December 1984.</p>
      <p>Our second great goal is to build on America's pioneer spirit--I said
         something funny? I said America's next frontier--and that's to develop
         that frontier. <span class="economy">A sparkling economy spurs initiatives, sunrise
            industries, and makes older ones more competitive.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Nowhere is this more important than our next frontier: space. Nowhere do
            we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability
            to make life better on Earth. The Space Age is barely a quarter of a
            century old. But already we've pushed civilization forward with our
            advances in science and technology.</span> Opportunities and jobs will multiply
         as we cross new thresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the
         unknown.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our progress in space--taking giant steps for all mankind--is a tribute
            to American teamwork and excellence. Our finest minds in government,
            industry, and academia have all pulled together.</span> And we can be proud to
         say: We are first; we are the best; and we are so because we're free.</p>
      <p>America has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reach
         for greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living
         and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain.
         Tonight, I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space
         station and to do it within a decade.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science,
            communications, in metals, and in lifesaving medicines which could be
            manufactured only in space. We want our friends to help us meet these
            challenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries
            to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand
            freedom for all who share our goals.</span></p>
      <p>Just as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and Yankee
         traders, space holds enormous potential for commerce today. The market
         for space transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it.
         Companies interested in putting payloads into space must have ready
         access to private sector launch services. <span class="infra">The Department of
            Transportation will help an expendable launch services industry to get
            off the ground. We'll soon implement a number of executive initiatives,
            develop proposals to ease regulatory constraints, and, with NASA's help,
            promote private sector investment in space.</span></p>
      <p>And as we develop the frontier of space, let us remember our
         responsibility to preserve our older resources here on Earth.
         Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative
         challenge, it's common sense.</p>
      <p>Though this is a time of budget constraints, I have requested for EPA
         one of the largest percentage budget increases of any agency. We will
         begin the long, necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational
         area and a special national resource--the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
      <p>To reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps, EPA will
         spend $410 million. And I will request a supplemental increase of 50
         million. And because the Superfund law expires in 1985, I've asked Bill
         Ruckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there'll be
         additional time to complete this important task.</p>
      <p>On the question of acid rain, which concerns people in many areas of the
         United States and Canada, I'm proposing a research program that doubles
         our current funding. And we'll take additional action to restore our
         lakes and develop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid
         rain.</p>
      <p>We have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources. We'll
         ask the Congress for $157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park
         and conservation lands. The Department of the Interior will encourage
         careful, selective exploration and production on our vital resources in
         an Exclusive Economic Zone within the 200-mile limit off our coasts--but
         with strict adherence to environmental laws and with fuller State and
         public participation.</p>
      <p>But our most precious resources, our greatest hope for the future, are
         the minds and hearts of our people, especially our children. We can help
         them build tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values.
         This must be our third great goal. For us, faith, work, family,
         neighborhood, freedom, and peace are not just words; they're expressions
         of what America means, definitions of what makes us a good and loving
         people.</p>
      <p>Families stand at the center of our society. And every family has a
         personal stake in promoting excellence in education. Excellence does not
         begin in Washington. A 600-percent increase in Federal spending on
         education between 1960 and 1980 was accompanied by a steady decline in
         Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. Excellence must begin in our homes and
         neighborhood schools, where it's the responsibility of every parent and
         teacher and the right of every child.</p>
      <p>Our children come first, and that's why I established a bipartisan
         National Commission on Excellence in Education, to help us chart a
         commonsense course for better education. And already, communities are
         implementing the Commission's recommendations. Schools are reporting
         progress in math and reading skills. But we must do more to restore
         discipline to schools; and we must encourage the teaching of new basics,
         reward teachers of merit, enforce tougher standards, and put our parents
         back in charge.</p>
      <p>I will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunities
         for families and to soften the double payment for those paying public
         school taxes and private school tuition. Our proposal would target
         assistance to low- and middle-income families. Just as more incentives
         are needed within our schools, greater competition is needed among our
         schools. Without standards and competition, there can be no champions,
         no records broken, no excellence in education or any other walk of life.</p>
      <p>And while I'm on this subject, each day your Members observe a
         200-year-old tradition meant to signify America is one nation under God.
         I must ask: If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy
         standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to
         acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across
         this land?</p>
      <p>America was founded by people who believed that God was their rock of
         safety. He is ours. I recognize we must be cautious in claiming that God
         is on our side, but I think it's all right to keep asking if we're on
         His side.</p>
      <p>During our first 3 years, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore
         protection of the law to unborn children. Now, I know this issue is very
         controversial. But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn
         child is not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof
         that it isn't? No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the
         evidence is to the contrary. We should rise above bitterness and
         reproach, and if Americans could come together in a spirit of
         understanding and helping, then we could find positive solutions to the
         tragedy of abortion.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Economic recovery, better education, rededication to values, all show
            the spirit of renewal gaining the upper hand</span>. And all will improve
         family life in the eighties. But families need more. They need assurance
         that they and their loved ones can walk the streets of America without
         being afraid. Parents need to know their children will not be victims of
         child pornography and abduction. This year we will intensify our drive
         against these and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family
         violence.</p>
      <p>Already our efforts to crack down on career criminals, organized crime,
         drugpushers, and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are having
         effect. In 1982 the crime rate dropped by 4.3 percent, the biggest
         decline since 1972. Protecting victims is just as important as
         safeguarding the rights of defendants.</p>
      <p>Opportunities for all Americans will increase if we move forward in fair
         housing and work to ensure women's rights, provide for equitable
         treatment in pension benefits and Individual Retirement Accounts,
         facilitate child care, and enforce delinquent parent support payments.</p>
      <p>It's not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our
         values and shape our future. So, I ask your help in assisting more
         communities to break the bondage of dependency. Help us to free
         enterprise by permitting debate and voting "yes" on our proposal for
         enterprise zones in America. <span class="poverty">This has been before you for 2 years. Its
            passage can help high-unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring
            neighborhoods.</span></p>
      <p>A society bursting with opportunities, reaching for its future with
         confidence, sustained by faith, fair play, and a conviction that good
         and courageous people will flourish when they're free--these are the
         secrets of a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the
         world.</p>
      <p>A lasting and meaningful peace is our fourth great goal. It is our
         highest aspiration. And our record is clear: Americans resort to force
         only when we must. We have never been aggressors. We have always
         struggled to defend freedom and democracy.</p>
      <p>We have no territorial ambitions. We occupy no countries. We build no
         walls to lock people in. Americans build the future. And our vision of a
         better life for farmers, merchants, and working people, from the
         Americas to Asia, begins with a simple premise: The future is best
         decided by ballots, not bullets.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war
            on their neighbors.</span> Only when people are given a personal stake in
         deciding their own destiny, benefiting from their own risks, do they
         create societies that are prosperous, progressive, and free. Tonight, it
         is democracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry, prolonging life,
         and eliminating drudgery.</p>
      <p>When it comes to keeping America strong, free, and at peace, there
         should be no Republicans or Democrats, just patriotic Americans. We can
         decide the tough issues not by who is right, but by what is right.</p>
      <p>Together, we can continue to advance our agenda for peace. <span class="diplomacy">We can
            establish a more stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet
            Union; strengthen allied relations across the board; achieve real and
            equitable reductions in the levels of nuclear arms; reinforce our
            peacemaking efforts in the Middle East, Central America, and southern
            Africa; or assist developing countries, particularly our neighbors in
            the Western Hemisphere; and assist in the development of democratic
            institutions throughout the world.</span></p>
      <p>The wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of the
         Scowcroft commission, which strengthened our ability to deter war and
         protect peace. In that same spirit, I urge you to move forward with the
         Henry Jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the Bipartisan
         Commission on Central America.</p>
      <p>Your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon
         is also serving the cause of peace. <span class="diplomacy">We are making progress in Lebanon.
            For nearly 10 years, the Lebanese have lived from tragedy to tragedy
            with no hope for their future. Now the multinational peacekeeping force
            and our marines are helping them break their cycle of despair. There is
            hope for a free, independent, and sovereign Lebanon.</span> We must have the
         courage to give peace a chance. And we must not be driven from our
         objectives for peace in Lebanon by state-sponsored terrorism. We have
         seen this ugly specter in Beirut, Kuwait, and Rangoon. It demands
         international attention. I will forward shortly legislative proposals to
         help combat terrorism. And I will be seeking support from our allies for
         concerted action.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our NATO alliance is strong. 1983 was a banner year for political
            courage. And we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships
            in the Far East. We're committed to dialog, deterrence, and promoting
            prosperity.</span> We'll work with our trading partners for a new round of
         negotiations in support of freer world trade, greater competition, and
         more open markets.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A rebirth of bipartisan cooperation, of economic growth, <span class="war">and military
               deterrence, and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and
               our allies abroad underline a fundamental and far-reaching change: The
               United States is safer, stronger, and more secure in 1984 than before.
               We can now move with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace,
               and we will.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Tonight, I want to speak to the people of the Soviet Union, to tell them
               it's true that our governments have had serious differences, but our
               sons and daughters have never fought each other in war. And if we
               Americans have our way, they never will.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">People of the Soviet Union, there is only one sane policy, for your
               country and mine, to preserve our civilization in this modern age: A
               nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.</span></span> The only value in
         our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will
         never be used. But then would it not be better to do away with them
         entirely?</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">People of the Soviet, President Dwight Eisenhower, who fought by your
               side in World War II, said the essential struggle "is not merely man
               against man or nation against nation. It is man against war."</span></span> Americans
         are people of peace. If your government wants peace, there will be
         peace. We can come together in faith and friendship to build a safer and
         far better world for our children and our children's children. And the
         whole world will rejoice. That is my message to you.</p>
      <p>Some days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us
         or a friend to help us, we find a person who reminds us what it means to
         be Americans.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Sergeant Stephen Trujillo, a medic in the 2d Ranger Battalion, 75th
            Infantry, was in the first helicopter to land at the compound held by
            Cuban forces in Grenada. He saw three other helicopters crash. Despite
            the imminent explosion of the burning aircraft, he never hesitated. He
            ran across 25 yards of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wounded
            soldiers.</span> He directed two other medics, administered first aid, and
         returned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends
         to safety.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Trujillo, you and your fellow service men and women not only
         saved innocent lives; you set a nation free. You inspire us as a force
         for freedom, not for despotism; and, yes, for peace, not conquest. God
         bless you.</p>
      <p>And then there are unsung heroes: single parents, couples, church and
         civic volunteers. Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of
         family and community problems. They soothe our sorrow, heal our wounds,
         calm our fears, and share our joy.</p>
      <p>A person like Father Ritter is always there. His Covenant House programs
         in New York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of
         frightened and abused children each year. The same is true of Dr.
         Charles Carson. Paralyzed in a plane crash, he still believed nothing is
         impossible. Today in Minnesota, he works 80 hours a week without pay,
         helping pioneer the field of computer-controlled walking. He has given
         hope to 500,000 paralyzed Americans that some day they may walk again.</p>
      <p>How can we not believe in the greatness of America? How can we not do
         what is right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on
         Earth? After all our struggles to restore America, to revive confidence
         in our country, hope for our future, after all our hard-won victories
         earned through the patience and courage of every citizen, we cannot,
         must not, and will not turn back. We will finish our job. How could we
         do less? We're Americans.</p>
      <p>Carl Sandburg said, "I see America not in the setting sun of a black
         night of despair... I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun
         fresh from the burning, creative hand of God... I see great days ahead
         for men and women of will and vision."</p>
      <p>I've never felt more strongly that America's best days and democracy's
         best days lie ahead. We're a powerful force for good. With faith and
         courage, we can perform great deeds and take freedom's next step. And we
         will. We will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who
         have brought light where there was darkness, warmth where there was
         cold, medicine where there was disease, <span class="poverty">food where there was hunger,</span> <span class="war">and
            peace where there was only bloodshed.</span></p>
      <p>Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time,
         that in our time we did everything that could be done. We finished the
         race; we kept them free; we kept the faith.</p>
      <p>Thank you very much. God bless you, and God bless America.</p>

      <h3>February 6, 1985</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress,
         honored guests, and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>I come before you to report on the state of our Union, and I'm pleased
         to report that after 4 years of united effort, the American people have
         brought forth a nation renewed, stronger, freer, and more secure than
         before.</p>
      <p>Four years ago we began to change, forever I hope, our assumptions about
         government and its place in our lives. <span class="economy">Out of that change has come great
            and robust growth--in our confidence, our economy, and our role in the
            world.</span></p>
      <p>Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear. We
         believe faith and freedom must be our guiding stars, for they show us
         truth, they make us brave, give us hope, and leave us wiser than we
         were. Our progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of our
         families, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together,
         are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Four years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people
            greater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more
            of what they earned.</span> We did what we promised, and a great industrial
         giant is reborn.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth, the
            strongest in 34 years; a 3-year inflation average of 3.9 percent, the
            lowest in 17 years; and 7.3 million new jobs in 2 years, with more of
            our citizens working than ever before.</span></p>
      <p>New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success:</p>
      <p>For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if (as)
         the family goes, so goes our civilization;</p>
      <p>For an America of vision that sees tomorrow's dreams in the learning and
         hard work we do today;</p>
      <p>For an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet,
         proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom;</p>
      <p>For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out
         for help.</p>
      <p>We have begun well. But it's only a beginning. We're not here to
         congratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves
         to finish what has not yet been done.</p>
      <p>We're here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real
         jobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach. We're here to
         speak for the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in
         industries fighting to modernize and compete. And, yes, we're here to
         stand, and proudly so, for all who struggle to break free from
         totalitarianism, for all who know in their hearts that freedom is the
         one true path to peace and human happiness.</p>
      <p>Proverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish. When asked what
         great principle holds our Union together, Abraham Lincoln said:
         "Something in (the) Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people
         of this country, but hope to the world for all future time."</p>
      <p>We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the
         dreams their vision foresaw. My fellow citizens, this nation is poised
         for greatness. The time has come to proceed toward a great new
         challenge--a second American Revolution of hope and opportunity; a
         revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back
         frontiers of knowledge and space; a revolution of spirit that taps the
         soul of America, enabling us to summon greater strength than we've ever
         known; and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden
         promise of human freedom in a world of peace.</p>
      <p>Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom. There are no
         constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no
         barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect. <span class="economy">Already,
            pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record
            growth.</span></p>
      <p>In Europe, they're calling it "the American Miracle." Day by day, we're
         shattering accepted notions of what is possible. When I was growing up,
         we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our
         marketplace. <span class="infra">Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in
            technology are transforming our lives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">In the late 1950's workers at the ATandT semiconductor plant in
            Pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for $7.50 apiece. They now
            produce over a million for less than a penny apiece.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut
            diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes,
            reduce hospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving
            human lives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased worker
            productivity, and is competitive once again.</span></p>
      <p>We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more,
         be more. <span class="economy">Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it's getting
            younger and stronger. It doesn't need rest and supervision; it needs new
            challenge, greater freedom. And that word "freedom" is the key to the
            second American revolution that we need to bring about.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for
            fairness and growth. Last year I asked Treasury Secretary-then-Regan to
            develop a plan to simplify the tax code, so all taxpayers would be
            treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent, yet the tax system remains
            unfair and limits our potential for growth</span>. Exclusions and exemptions
         cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels. <span class="poverty">Low-income
            families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder. The
            Treasury Department has produced an excellent reform plan, whose
            principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise. We
            will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need.
            We will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many
            tax preferences. We will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent,
            and possibly lower. And we will propose reducing corporate rates, while
            maintaining incentives for capital formation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we
            will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be
            totally exempt from Federal income tax.</span> To restore fairness to families,
         we will propose increasing significantly the personal exemption.</p>
      <p>And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker--I have to
         get used to saying that--to begin working with congressional authors and
         committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles. We
         will call upon the American people for support and upon every man and
         woman in this Chamber. <span class="economy">Together, we can pass, this year, a tax bill for
            fairness, simplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our
            dreams and America the investment capital of the world.</span> So let us begin.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous
            pent-up power of our economy.</span> But a second American revolution must
         carry the promise of opportunity for all. It is time to liberate the
         spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">This government will meet its responsibility to help those in need.</span> But
         policies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroy
         self-respect are not progressive; they're reactionary. <span class="civil-rights"><span class="economy">Despite our
               strides in civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not
               have full and equal power until they have full economic power.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in
            the abandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build
            better lives.</span> This legislation is supported by a majority of you.</p>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans.
         Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation
         of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year. And, Tip, you
         could make that a birthday present.</p>
      <p>Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity
         wage proposal. We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment
         rate, find summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have
         confidence in their futures.</p>
      <p>We'll continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act, which has a
         nearly two-thirds job placement rate. Credits in education and health
         care vouchers will help working families shop for services that they
         need.</p>
      <p>Our administration is already encouraging certain low-income public
         housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings. It's time that
         all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership.</p>
      <p>The Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom.<span class="economy"> But
            States and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery,
            must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers
            to growth.</span></p>
      <p>Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start
         spreading opportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start
         spreading freedom.</p>
      <p>There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action
         on deficit reductions. <span class="economy">Well, the best way to reduce deficits is through
            economic growth. More businesses will be started, more investments made,
            more jobs created, and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes. The
            best way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for
            spending by increasing prosperity. Each added percentage point per year
            of real GNP growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of
            nearly $200 billion over 5 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten
            government's claim on our total economy. We will not do this by raising
            taxes. We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth
            in spending by the Federal Government. In our fiscal year 1986 budget,
            overall government program spending will be frozen at the current level.
            It must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points
            are key.</span></p>
      <p>First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled,
         and unemployed will be left intact. <span class="infra">Growth of our major health care
            programs, Medicare and Medicaid, will be slowed, but protections for the
            elderly and needy will be preserved.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just
            as we near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional
            corps. National security is government's first responsibility; so in
            past years defense spending took about half the Federal budget. Today it
            takes less than a third. We've already reduced our planned defense
            expenditures by nearly a hundred billion dollars over the past 4 years
            and reduced projected spending again this year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">You know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time of
            danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy. Spending for
            defense is investing in things that are priceless--peace and freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies. For
            example, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper
            airfares, but on Amtrak taxpayers pay about $35 per passenger every time
            an Amtrak train leaves the station, It's time we ended this huge Federal
            subsidy</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years. Yet I know from
            visiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an
            orderly transition to a market-oriented farm economy.</span> We can help
         farmers best not by expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental
         reforms, keeping interest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign
         trade barriers to American farm exports.</p>
      <p>We're moving ahead with Grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and
         improve government's management practices. <span class="economy">In the long run, we must
            protect the taxpayers from government. And I ask again that you pass, as
            32 States have now called for, an amendment mandating the Federal
            Government spend no more than it takes in. And I ask for the authority,
            used responsibly by 43 Governors, to veto individual items in
            appropriation bills. Senator Mattingly has introduced a bill permitting
            a 2-year trial run of the line-item veto.</span> I hope you'll pass and send
         that legislation to my desk.</p>
      <p>Nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to
         a time of reckoning. Ours is but a moment in history. But one moment of
         courage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history
         forever.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and
            stability. We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board,
            seeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping
            interest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra"><span class="economy">Reducing unneeded red tape and regulations, and deregulating the energy,
               transportation, and financial industries have unleashed new competition,
               giving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices.</span> In
            just one set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations
            to 31. We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies
            and bring us closer to energy independence.</span> <span class="infra">Consistent with safety
            standards, we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad
            industries, we will soon end up legislation--or send up legislation, I
            should say--to return Conrail to the private sector where it belongs,
            and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Every dollar the Federal Government does not take from us, every
            decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our
            lives more abundant, our future more free.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our second American revolution will push on to new possibilities not
            only on Earth but in the next frontier of space. Despite budget
            restraints, we will seek record funding for research and development.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We've seen the success of the space shuttle. Now we're going to develop
            a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free
            enterprise, because in the next decade Americans and our friends around
            the world will be living and working together in space.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving
            medicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth. We can make crystals
            of exceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs,
            technologies, and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed
            possible.</span></p>
      <p>As we do all this, we'll continue to protect our natural resources. We
         will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program
         to continue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human
         health and the environment.</p>
      <p>Now, there's another great heritage to speak of this evening. Of all the
         changes that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greater
         promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family,
         work, and neighborhood.</p>
      <p>We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship;
         renewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered
         by our young, who are leading the way. We've rediscovered that work is
         good in and of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no
         matter how seemingly humble our jobs. We've seen a powerful new current
         from an old and honorable tradition--American generosity.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">From thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food
            production in Africa, to millions volunteering time, corporations
            adopting schools, and communities pulling together to help the neediest
            among us at home, we have refound our values. Private sector initiatives
            are crucial to our future.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving
            religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that
            other groups enjoy. But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder,
            if a child stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer.</span> We ask you
         again, give children back a right they had for a century and a half or
         more in this country.</p>
      <p>The question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking
         of a human life or it isn't. And if it is--and medical technology is
         increasingly showing it is--it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony
         that while some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become
         parents cry out for children to adopt. We have room for these children.
         We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love. And tonight I
         ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect the
         unborn.</p>
      <p>In the area of education, we're returning to excellence, and again, the
         heroes are our people, not government. We're stressing basics of
         discipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children
         become computer-smart as well. For 20 years scholastic aptitude test
         scores of our high school students went down, but now they have gone up
         2 of the last 3 years. We must go forward in our commitment to the new
         basics, giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers
         are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay.</p>
      <p>Of all the changes in the past 20 years, none has more threatened our
         sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime. One
         does not have to be attacked to be a victim. The woman who must run to
         her car after shopping at night is a victim. The couple draping their
         door with locks and chains are victims; as is the tired, decent cleaning
         woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid.</p>
      <p>We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants. But shouldn't we
         feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit
         crime? For the first time in 20 years, the crime index has fallen 2
         years in a row. We've convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them,
         as well as leaders of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers.</p>
      <p>But we must do more. I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact
         proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers
         acquire in good faith. These proposals would also reform the habeas
         corpus laws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming
         majority of Americans, the use of the death penalty where necessary.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among
            us are allowed to roam free. It's time we restored domestic tranquility.
            And we mean to do just that.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our
            economy, we're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more
            peaceful world. <span class="diplomacy">Our alliances are stronger than ever.</span> Our economy is
            stronger than ever. We have resumed our historic role as a leader of the
            free world. And all of these together are a great force for peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Since 1981 we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms
            agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of
            nuclear arsenals. Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has
            influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table</span>. Our
         negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of
         the American people. All of us have no greater dream than to see the day
         when nuclear weapons are banned from this Earth forever.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Each Member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our
            defenses, thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement.
            Your vote this spring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test
            of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual
            and verifiable arms reductions.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">For the past 20 years we've believed that no war will be launched as
            long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike.
            Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of
            nuclear war. It is a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at
            finding a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missiles.</span> It's the most
         hopeful possibility of the nuclear age. But it's not very well
         understood.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter
            war in the heavens and on Earth. Now, some say the research would be
            expensive. Perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity
            itself. And some say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a
            defense system of their own. Well, they already have strategic defenses
            that surpass ours; a civil defense system, where we have almost none;
            and a research program covering roughly the same areas of technology
            that we're now exploring.</span> And finally some say the research will take a
         long time. Well, the answer to that is: Let's get started.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Harry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world's
            hopes for peace and human progress "lie not in measures of defense or in
            the control of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and
            self-government.</span>"</p>
      <p>And tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world:
         Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal
         right of all God's children. Look to where peace and prosperity flourish
         today. It is in homes that freedom built. <span class="poverty">Victories against poverty are
            greatest and peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure
            free press, free speech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create
            wealth.</span></p>
      <p>Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to
         communicate these ideals everywhere we can. America's economic success
         is freedom's success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred
         different nations. <span class="economy">Many countries in east Asia and the Pacific have few
            resources other than the enterprise of their own people. But through low
            tax rates and free markets they've soared ahead of centralized
            economies. And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and
            implementing trade policy, and we'll be studying potential changes in
            that process in the next few weeks. We've seen the benefits of free
            trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism. Tonight I ask
            all our trading partners, developed and developing alike, to join us in
            a new round of trade negotiations to expand trade and competition and
            strengthen the global economy--and to begin it in this next year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">There are more than 3 billion human beings living in Third World
            countries with an average per capita income of $650 a year. Many are
            victims of dictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and
            corruption. Let us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of
            trade and assistance that fosters economic development through personal
            incentives to help these people climb from poverty on their own.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that's not innocent; nor can
            we be passive when freedom is under siege. Without resources, diplomacy
            cannot succeed.</span> <span class="war">Our security assistance programs help friendly
            governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for
            peace. And I hope that you in the Congress will understand that, dollar
            for dollar, security assistance contributes as much to global security
            as our own defense budget.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith
            with those who are risking their lives--on every continent, from
            Afghanistan to Nicaragua--to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure
            rights which have been ours from birth.</span></p>
      <p>The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban-Soviet bloc
         support, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free
         press, but arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists attacking
         neighboring states. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and
         totally consistent with the OAS and U.N. Charters. It is essential that
         the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America. I
         want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is
         tied to our own security.</p>
      <p>And tonight, I've spoken of great plans and great dreams. They're dreams
         we can make come true. Two hundred years of American history should have
         taught us that nothing is impossible.</p>
      <p>Ten years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the
         exodus that followed the fall of Saigon. They came to the United States
         with no possessions and not knowing a word of English. Ten years
         ago--the young girl studied hard, learned English, and finished high
         school in the top of her class. And this May, May 22d to be exact, is a
         big date on her calendar. Just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam,
         she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.
         I thought you might like to meet an American hero named Jean Nguyen.</p>
      <p>Now, there's someone else here tonight, born 79 years ago. She lives in
         the inner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are
         heroin addicts. The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even
         dropped on her doorstep. She helps them with love. Go to her house some
         night, and maybe you'll see her silhouette against the window as she
         walks the floor talking softly, soothing a child in her arms--Mother
         Hale of Harlem, and she, too, is an American hero.</p>
      <p>Jean, Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is
         new again: Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the
         will, and the heart. History is asking us once again to be a force for
         good in the world. Let us begin in unity, with justice, and love.</p>

      <h3>February 4, 1986</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress,
         honored guests, and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>Thank you for allowing me to delay my address until this evening. We
         paused together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven Challenger
         heroes. And I hope that we are now ready to do what they would want us
         to do: Go forward, America, and reach for the stars. We will never
         forget those brave seven, but we shall go forward.</p>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out that
         tonight marks the 10th and last State of the Union Message that you've
         presided over. And on behalf of the American people, I want to salute
         you for your service to Congress and country. Here's to you!</p>
      <p>I have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of
         unfinished work, and to set our sights on the future. I am pleased to
         report the state of our Union is stronger than a year ago and growing
         stronger each day. Tonight we look out on a rising America, firm of
         heart, united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism. America is on
         the move! But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land:
         locked factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices, and
         interest rates turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of
         broken dreams. Government growing beyond our consent had become a
         lumbering giant, slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to
         crush the very roots of our freedom. What brought America back? The
         American people brought us back with quiet courage and common sense,
         with undying faith that in this nation under God the future will be
         ours; for the future belongs to the free.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of
            economic growth, for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9
            million new jobs in 3 years, interest rates cut in half, inflation
            falling over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today, and a mighty
            river of good works--a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last
            year alone.</span> And despite the pressures of our modern world, family and
         community remain the moral core of our society, guardians of our values
         and hopes for the future. Family and community are the costars of this
         great American comeback. They are why we say tonight: Private values
         must be at the heart of public policies.</p>
      <p>What is true for families in America is true for America in the family
         of free nations. History is no captive of some inevitable force. History
         is made by men and women of vision and courage. Tonight freedom is on
         the march. The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which
         the world once again turns. We stand for an idea whose time is now: Only
         by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly
         prosper and can peace among all nations be secure. Teddy Roosevelt said
         that a nation that does great work lives forever. We have done well, but
         we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons. It's time for
         America to be all that we can be.</p>
      <p>We speak tonight of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer,
         more secure world. And we speak about the necessity for actions to steel
         us for the challenges of growth, trade, and security in the next decade
         and the year 2000. And we will do it--not by breaking faith with bedrock
         principles but by breaking free from failed policies. Let us begin where
         storm clouds loom darkest--right here in Washington, DC. This week I
         will send you our detailed proposals; tonight let us speak of our
         responsibility to redefine government's role: not to control, not to
         demand or command, not to contain us, but to help in times of need and,
         above all, to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that
         all Americans can climb toward economic power and justice on their own.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">But we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can't
            even pass a Federal budget. We cannot win that race held back by
            horse-and-buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human
            potential. We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink.
            Now, Mr. Speaker, you know, I know, and the American people know the
            Federal budget system is broken. It doesn't work.</span> Before we leave this
         city, let's you and I work together to fix it, and then we can finally
         give the American people a balanced budget.</p>
      <p>Members of Congress, passage of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings gives us an
         historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership
         for decades: forcing the Federal Government to live within its means.
         Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by April
         15th, the very day America's families have to foot the bill for the
         budgets that you produce. How often we read of a husband and wife both
         working, struggling from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a
         mortgage, pay their taxes and bills. And yet some in Congress say taxes
         must be raised. Well, I'm sorry; they're asking the wrong people to
         tighten their belts. It's time we reduce the Federal budget and left the
         family budget alone. We do not face large deficits because American
         families are undertaxed; we face those deficits because the Federal
         Government overspends.</p>
      <p>The detailed budget that we will submit will meet the
         Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target for deficit reductions, meet our commitment
         to ensure a strong national defense, meet our commitment to protect
         Social Security and the truly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our
         commitment to not raise taxes. How should we accomplish this? Well, not
         by taking from those in need. As families take care of their own,
         government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot
         provide for themselves. But we must revise or replace programs enacted
         in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work,
         encourage family breakups, and drive entire communities into a bleak and
         heartless dependency. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings can mark a dramatic
         improvement. But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets
         does not assure they'll be met. We must proceed with Grace commission
         reforms against waste.</p>
      <p>And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 Governors have: Give me a
         line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll
         take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat. This
         authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent
         spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own
         merit. And you can sustain or override my veto; that's the way the
         system should work. Once we've made the hard choices, we should lock in
         our gains with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.</p>
      <p><span class="war">I mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense. We
            must meet it. Defense is not just another budget expense. Keeping
            America strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the
            Federal Government; it is government's prime responsibility. We have
            devoted 5 years trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and
            neglect, and we've made important gains. Yet the threat from Soviet
            forces, conventional and strategic, from the Soviet drive for
            domination, from the increase in espionage and state terror remains
            great. This is reality. Closing our eyes will not make reality
            disappear. We pledged together to hold real growth in defense spending
            to the bare minimum. My budget honors that pledge, and I'm now asking
            you, the Congress, to keep its end of the bargain. The Soviets must know
            that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced
            threat, not a reduced resolve.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">Keeping America strong is as vital to the national security as
               controlling Federal spending is to our economic security. But, as I have
               said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the Federal
               deficit is an ever-expanding American economy, unfettered and free. The
               magic of opportunity--unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained--isn't this
               the calling that unites us? I believe our tax rate cuts for the people
               have done more to spur a spirit of risk-taking and help America's
               economy break free than any program since John Kennedy's tax cut almost
               a quarter century ago.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic
            tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay
            their fair share, but no more. We've come this far. Will you join me
            now, and we'll walk this last mile together? You know my views on this.
            We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in
            disguise. True reform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and
            that means a top personal rate no higher than 35 percent. True reform
            must be truly fair, and that means raising personal exemptions to
            $2,000. True reform means a tax system that at long last is profamily,
            projobs, profuture, and pro-America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">As we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts
            for freer and fairer trade. We have already taken actions to counter
            unfair trading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets. We will
            continue to do so. We will also oppose legislation touted as providing
            protection that in reality pits one American worker against another, one
            industry against another, one community against another, and that raises
            prices for us all. If the United States can trade with other nations on
            a level playing field, we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell
            anybody, anywhere in the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and
            stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world. We
            must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and
            other exporters.</span> Farmers, in particular, have suffered from past unwise
         government policies. They must not be abandoned with problems they did
         not create and cannot control. We've begun coordinating economic and
         monetary policy among our major trading partners. But there's more to
         do, and tonight I am directing Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to determine
         if the nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and
         relationship of our currencies.</p>
      <p>Confident in our future and secure in our values, Americans are striving
         forward to embrace the future. We see it not only in our recovery but in
         3 straight years of falling crime rates, as families and communities
         band together to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness and to give
         back to their children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they
         deserve. We see it in the renaissance in education, the rising SAT
         scores for 3 years--last year's increase, the greatest since 1963. It
         wasn't government and Washington lobbies that turned education around;
         it was the American people who, in reaching for excellence, knew to
         reach back to basics. We must continue the advance by supporting
         discipline in our schools, vouchers that give parents freedom of choice;
         and we must give back to our children their lost right to acknowledge
         God in their classrooms.</p>
      <p>We are a nation of idealists, yet today there is a wound in our national
         conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life
         granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn. For the rest of my time,
         I shall do what I can to see that this wound is one day healed.</p>
      <p>As we work to make the American dream real for all, we must also look to
         the condition of America's families. Struggling parents today worry how
         they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave
         them. In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most
         basic support system, has reached crisis proportions--in female and
         child poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating
         schools. After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the
         plight of the poor grows more painful. But the waste in dollars and
         cents pales before the most tragic loss: the sinful waste of human
         spirit and potential. We can ignore this terrible truth no longer. As
         Franklin Roosevelt warned 51 years ago, standing before this Chamber, he
         said, "Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit."
         And we must now escape the spider's web of dependency.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Tonight I am charging the White House Domestic Council to present me by
            December 1, 1986, an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate
            action to meet the financial, educational, social, and safety concerns
            of poor families. I'm talking about real and lasting emancipation,
            because the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its
            recipients become independent of welfare.</span> Further, after seeing how
         devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family, I
         am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis Bowen,
         to report to me by year end with recommendations on how the private
         sector and government can work together to address the problems of
         affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be
         threatened when catastrophic illness strikes.</p>
      <p>And tonight I want to speak directly to America's younger generation,
         because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands. With all the
         temptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of the
         permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control. But the
         call of the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in
         the blind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair. Never has there
         been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and
         heroic achievement. As they said in the film "Back to the Future,"
         "Where we're going, we don't need roads."</p>
      <p>Well, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of
         subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith. Astronomers
         build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and
         possibly back to the moment of creation. <span class="infra">So, yes, this nation remains
            fully committed to America's space program. We're going forward with our
            shuttle flights. We're going forward to build our space station. And we
            are going forward with research on a new Orient Express that could, by
            the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles Airport, accelerate up
            to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to
            Tokyo within 2 hours. And the same technology transforming our lives can
            solve the greatest problem of the 20th century.</span> <span class="war">A security shield can
            one day render nuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison
            of nuclear terror. America met one historic challenge and went to the
            Moon. Now America must meet another: to make our strategic defense real
            for all the citizens of planet Earth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future: to leave our
            children a land that is free and just and a world at peace. It is my
            hope that our fireside summit in Geneva and Mr. Gorbachev's upcoming
            visit to America can lead to a more stable relationship. Surely no
            people on Earth hate war or love peace more than we Americans. But we
            cannot stroll into the future with childlike faith. Our differences with
            a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged right to command
            people's lives and to export its ideology by force are deep and abiding.
            Logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by
            realism--rock-hard, cleareyed, steady, and sure. Our negotiators in
            Geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side with
            no cheating. They have made clear that Soviet compliance with the letter
            and spirit of agreements is essential. If the Soviet Government wants an
            agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be such an
            agreement</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">But arms control is no substitute for peace. We know that peace follows
            in freedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is
            denied.</span> <span class="economy">So, we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but
            by bolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we
            can. We advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on
            behalf of lower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the
            world.</span> We strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with
         allies and come to the aid of friends under siege. And we can enlarge
         the family of free nations if we will defend the unalienable rights of
         all God's children to follow their dreams.</p>
      <p>To those imprisoned in regimes held captive, to those beaten for daring
         to fight for freedom and democracy--for their right to worship, to
         speak, to live, and to prosper in the family of free nations--we say to
         you tonight: You are not alone, freedom fighters. America will support
         with moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die
         for freedom but to fight and win freedom--to win freedom in Afghanistan,
         in Angola, in Cambodia, and in Nicaragua. This is a great moral
         challenge for the entire free world.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for
            the security of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital
            interests, than to achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect
            Nicaragua's democratic neighbors.</span> This year I will be asking Congress
         for the means to do what must be done for that great and good cause. As
         (former Senator Henry M.)Scoop Jackson, the inspiration for our
         Bipartisan Commission on Central America, once said, "In matters of
         national security, the best politics is no politics."</p>
      <p>What we accomplish this year, in each challenge we face, will set our
         course for the balance of the decade, indeed, for the remainder of the
         century. After all we've done so far, let no one say that this nation
         cannot reach the destiny of our dreams. America believes, America is
         ready, America can win the race to the future--and we shall. The
         American dream is a song of hope that rings through night winter air;
         vivid, tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire
         to the greatest things: to venture a daring enterprise; to unearth new
         beauty in music, literature, and art; to discover a new universe inside
         a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell.</p>
      <p>We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard
         Cavoli. All his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.
         And, Richard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school
         was launched and lost last week, yet your dream lives. And as long as
         it's real, work of noble note will yet be done, work that could reduce
         the harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view
         the golden gateways of the farthest stars.</p>
      <p>We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old, Tyrone
         Ford. A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal
         adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer. He also directs
         the choirs of three churches and has performed at the Kennedy Center.
         With God as your composer, Tyrone, your music will be the music of
         angels.</p>
      <p>We see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13-year-old Shelby
         Butler, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol. Seeing
         another girl freeze in terror before an out-of-control school bus, she
         risked her life and pulled her to safety. With bravery like yours,
         Shelby, America need never fear for our future.</p>
      <p>And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year
         old, Trevor Ferrell. Two years ago, age 11, watching men and women
         bedding down in abandoned doorways--on television he was
         watching--<span class="poverty">Trevor left his suburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets
            and food to the helpless and homeless. And now 250 people help him
            fulfill his nightly vigil. Trevor, yours is the living spirit of
            brotherly love.</span></p>
      <p>Would you four stand up for a moment? Thank you, thank you. You are
         heroes of our hearts. We look at you and know it's true: In this land of
         dreams fulfilled, where greater dreams may be imagined, nothing is
         impossible, no victory is beyond our reach, no glory will ever be too
         great.</p>
      <p>So, now it's up to us, all of us, to prepare America for that day when
         our work will pale before the greatness of America's champions in the
         21st century. The world's hopes rest with America's future; America's
         hopes rest with us. So, let us go forward to create our world of
         tomorrow in faith, in unity, and in love.</p>
      <p>God bless you, and God bless America.</p>

      <h3>January 27, 1987</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored
         guests, and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>May I congratulate all of you who are Members of this historic 100th
         Congress of the United States of America. In this 200th anniversary year
         of our Constitution, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants--men
         whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom. However, we must
         always remember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being
         old, but for being young--young with the same energy, spirit, and
         promise that filled each eventful day in Philadelphia's statehouse. We
         will be guided tonight by their acts, and we will be guided forever by
         their words.</p>
      <p>Now, forgive me, but I can't resist sharing a story from those historic
         days. Philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787,
         and its newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the Convention
         delegates with elaborate social classifications. Governors of States
         were called Excellency. Justices and Chancellors had reserved for them
         honorable with a capital "H." For Congressmen, it was honorable with a
         small "h." And all others were referred to as "the following respectable
         characters." Well, for this 100th Congress, I invoke special executive
         powers to declare that each of you must never be titled less than
         honorable with a capital "H." Incidentally, I'm delighted you are
         celebrating the 100th birthday of the Congress. It's always a pleasure
         to congratulate someone with more birthdays than I've had.</p>
      <p>Now, there's a new face at this place of honor tonight. And please join
         me in warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House, Jim Wright. Mr.
         Speaker, you might recall a similar situation in your very first session
         of Congress 32 years ago. Then, as now, the speakership had changed
         hands and another great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn--"Mr. Sam"--sat in
         your chair. I cannot find better words than those used by President
         Eisenhower that evening. He said, "We shall have much to do together; I
         am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and
         good will." Tonight I renew that pledge. To you, Mr. Speaker, and to
         Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, who brings 34 years of distinguished
         service to the Congress, may I say: Though there are changes in the
         Congress, America's interests remain the same. And I am confident that,
         along with Republican leaders Bob Michel and Bob Dole, this Congress can
         make history.</p>
      <p>Six years ago I was here to ask the Congress to join me in America's new
         beginning. <span class="economy">Well, the results are something of which we can all be proud.
            Our inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century. The
            prime interest rate has fallen from the 21 1/2 percent the month before
            we took office to 7 1/2 percent today. And those rates have triggered
            the most housing starts in 8 years. The unemployment rate--still too
            high--is the lowest in nearly 7 years, and our people have created
            nearly 13 million new jobs. Over 61 percent of everyone over the age of
            16, male and female, is employed--the highest percentage on record.
            Let's roll up our sleeves and go to work and put America's economic
            engine at full throttle.</span> We can also be heartened by our progress across
         the world. Most important, <span class="war">America is at peace tonight, and freedom is
            on the march. And we've done much these past years to restore our
            defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world. Our sons and
            daughters in the services once again wear their uniforms with pride.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But though we've made much progress, I have one major regret: I took a
            risk with regard to our action in Iran. It did not work, and for that I
            assume full responsibility. The goals were worthy. I do not believe it
            was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic
            importance or to try to save lives.</span> And certainly it was not wrong to
         try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity. But
         we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in
         trying to do so. We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take
         whatever action is called for. But in debating the past, we must not
         deny ourselves the successes of the future. Let it never be said of this
         generation of Americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we
         refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom
         in the world. Much is at stake here, and the Nation and the world are
         watching to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if
         we let partisanship weaken us. And let there be no mistake about
         American policy: We will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends
         in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield to terrorist
         blackmail.</p>
      <p>And now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don't we get to work?
         I am pleased to report that because of our efforts to rebuild the
         strength of America, the world is a safer place. Earlier this month I
         submitted a budget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make
         up for neglect in the last decade. <span class="war">Well, I ask you to vote out a defense
            and foreign affairs budget that says yes to protecting our country.
            While the world is safer, it is not safe.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Since 1970 the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military
            forces than we have. <span class="poverty">Even today, though nearly 1 in 3 Soviet families is
               without running hot water and the average family spends 2 hours a day
               shopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found
               the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the
               past 5 years--clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola,
               Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua. With 120,000 Soviet combat and
               military personnel and 15,000 military advisers in Asia, Africa, and
               Latin America, can anyone still doubt their single-minded determination
               to expand their power?</span></span> Despite this, the Congress cut my request for
         critical U.S. security assistance to free nations by 21 percent this
         year, and cut defense requests by $85 billion in the last 3 years.</p>
      <p>These assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual
         interests. And when the programs are devastated, American interests are
         harmed. My friends, it's my duty as President to say to you again
         tonight that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our
         resolve. <span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Today the brave people of Afghanistan are showing that resolve.
               The Soviet Union says it wants a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, yet
               it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly
               numbered. We are ready to support a political solution that guarantees
               the rapid withdrawal of all Soviet troops and genuine self-determination
               for the Afghan people.</span></span></p>
      <p>In Central America, too, the cause of freedom is being tested. And our
         resolve is being tested there as well. Here, especially, the world is
         watching to see how this nation responds. Today over 90 percent of the
         people of Latin America live in democracy. Democracy is on the march in
         Central and South America. Communist Nicaragua is the odd man
         out--suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent and
         promoting subversion in the region. <span class="war">We support diplomatic efforts, but
            these efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war against
            the Nicaraguan people.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our commitment to a Western Hemisphere safe from aggression did not
            occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office. It began
            with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan
            American policy.</span> Franklin Roosevelt said we "are determined to do
         everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere." President
         Truman was very blunt: "International communism seeks to crush and
         undermine and destroy the independence of the Americas. We cannot let
         that happen here." And John F. Kennedy made clear that "Communist
         domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiated." Some in this
         Congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment, but I will
         not.</p>
      <p>This year we celebrate the second century of our Constitution. The
         Sandinistas just signed theirs 2 weeks ago, and then suspended it. We
         won't know how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple
         reason: There is no free press in Nicaragua. Nicaraguan freedom fighters
         have never asked us to wage their battle, but I will fight any effort to
         shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life
         without freedom. There must be no Soviet beachhead in Central America.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">You know, we Americans have always preferred dialog to conflict, and so,
               we always remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet
               Union. But more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key
               element of the U.S.-Soviet agenda. Progress is also required on the
               other items of our agenda as well--real respect for human rights and
               more open contacts between our societies and, of course, arms reduction.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In Iceland, last October, we had one moment of opportunity that the
            Soviets dashed because they sought to cripple our Strategic Defense
            Initiative, SDI. I wouldn't let them do it then; I won't let them do it
            now or in the future</span>. This is the most positive and promising defense
         program we have undertaken. It's the path, for both sides, to a safer
         future--a system that defends human life instead of threatening it. SDI
         will go forward.<span class="diplomacy"> The United States has made serious, fair, and
            far-reaching proposals to the Soviet Union, and this is a moment of rare
            opportunity for arms reduction. But I will need, and American
            negotiators in Geneva will need, Congress' support. Enacting the Soviet
            negotiating position into American law would not be the way to win a
            good agreement. So, I must tell you in this Congress I will veto any
            effort that undercuts our national security and our negotiating
            leverage.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Now, today, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful
            commerce across the world. We will work to expand our opportunities in
            international markets through the Uruguay round of trade negotiations
            and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world's
            two largest trading partners, Canada and the United States. Our basic
            trade policy remains the same: We remain opposed as ever to
            protectionism, because America's growth and future depend on trade.</span> But
         we would insist on trade that is fair and free. We are always willing to
         be trade partners but never trade patsies.</p>
      <p>Now, from foreign borders let us return to our own, because America in
         the world is only as strong as America at home. This 100th Congress has
         high responsibilities. I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these
         are simply the incomplete obligations of the past. The American people
         deserve to be impatient, because we do not yet have the public house in
         order. <span class="economy">We've had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and
            we've rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the
            Depression. But there's more to do. For starters, the Federal deficit is
            outrageous. For years I've asked that we stop pushing onto our children
            the excesses of our government.</span> And what the Congress finally needs to
         do is pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget
         and forces government to live within its means. States, cities, and the
         families of America balance their budgets. Why can't we?</p>
      <p>Next, the budget process is a sorry spectacle. The missing of deadlines
         and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds
         of billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. We ask
         the Congress once again: Give us the same tool that 43 Governors have--a
         lineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork, those items
         that would never survive on their own. I will send the Congress broad
         recommendations on the budget, but first I'd like to see yours. Let's go
         to work and get this done together.</p>
      <p>But now let's talk about this year's budget. Even though I have
         submitted it within the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction target,
         I have seen suggestions that we might postpone that timetable. Well, I
         think the American people are tired of hearing the same old excuses.
         Together we made a commitment to balance the budget. <span class="economy">Now let's keep it.
            As for those suggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the American
            people have repeatedly rejected that shop-worn advice. They know that we
            don't have deficits because people are taxed too little. We have
            deficits because big government spends too much.</span></p>
      <p>Now, next month I'll place two additional reforms before the Congress.
         We've created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our
         sense of priorities. <span class="poverty"><span class="economy">Our national welfare system consists of some 59
               major programs and over 6,000 pages of Federal laws and regulations on
               which more than $132 billion was spent in 1985.</span></span> I will propose a new
         national welfare strategy, a program of welfare reform through
         State-sponsored, community-based demonstration projects. This is the
         time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the
         poverty trap. Now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of
         their own, must have our help. But let us work to see how many can be
         freed from the dependency of welfare and made self-supporting, which the
         great majority of welfare recipients want more than anything else. Next,
         let us remove a financial specter facing our older Americans: the fear
         of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an
         intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death. I will submit
         legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of
         catastrophic illness.</p>
      <p>Now let's turn to the future. It's widely said that America is losing
         her competitive edge. Well, that won't happen if we act now. How well
         prepared are we to enter the 21st century? In my lifetime, America set
         the standard for the world. It is now time to determine that we should
         enter the next century having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed
         in history. <span class="economy">We will achieve this, first, by guaranteeing that government
            does everything possible to promote America's ability to compete.
            Second, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will
            not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding.</span> Rather, it
         involves an expenditure of American spirit and just plain American grit.
         The Congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our
         competitiveness, including new science and technology centers and strong
         new funding for basic research. The bill will include legal and
         regulatory reforms and weapons to fight unfair trade practices.
         Competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating
         fairly and fully in a changing world market.</p>
      <p>Preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children. We
         need to set for them new and more rigorous goals. We must demand more of
         ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by
         the year 2000. Our children should master the basic concepts of math and
         science, and let's insist that students not leave high school until they
         have studied and understood the basic documents of our national
         heritage. There's one more thing we can't let up on: Let's redouble our
         personal efforts to provide for every child a safe and drug-free
         learning environment. If our crusade against drugs succeeds with our
         children, we will defeat that scourge all over the country.</p>
      <p>Finally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national
         being. Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help. Why
         is it that we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can't use a
         schoolroom for voluntary prayer? The 100th Congress of the United States
         should be remembered as the one that ended the expulsion of God from
         America's classrooms.</p>
      <p>The quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom
         but must go next to the workplace. <span class="economy">More than 20 million new jobs will be
            created before the new century unfolds, and by then, our economy should
            be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work. We must also
            enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the
            workplace.</span> And I will propose substantial, new Federal commitments keyed
         to retraining and job mobility.</p>
      <p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be sending the Congress a complete series
         of these special messages--on budget reform, welfare reform,
         competitiveness, including education, trade, worker training and
         assistance, agriculture, and other subjects. The Congress can give us
         these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just
         being our best. And that is the core of American greatness. The
         responsibility of freedom presses us towards higher knowledge and, I
         believe, moral and spiritual greatness. Through lower taxes and smaller
         government, government has its ways of freeing people's spirits. But
         only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar against our own individual
         standards. Excellence is what makes freedom ring. And isn't that what we
         do best?</p>
      <p>We're entering our third century now, but it's wrong to judge our nation
         by its years. The calendar can't measure America because we were meant
         to be an endless experiment in freedom--with no limit to our reaches, no
         boundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes. The United
         States Constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we
         travel through history. It grew out of the most fundamental inspiration
         of our existence: that we are here to serve Him by living free--that
         living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our
         abilities; that we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes
         and would secure them not just for ourselves and for our children but
         for all mankind.</p>
      <p>Over the years--I won't count if you don't--nothing has been so
         heartwarming to me as speaking to America's young, and the little ones
         especially, so fresh-faced and so eager to know. Well, from time to time
         I've been with them--they will ask about our Constitution. And I hope
         you Members of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if
         you'll permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who
         might be listening or watching this evening. I've read the constitutions
         of a number of countries, including the Soviet Union's. Now, some people
         are surprised to hear that they have a constitution, and it even
         supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people. Many countries
         have written into their constitution provisions for freedom of speech
         and freedom of assembly. Well, if this is true, why is the Constitution
         of the United States so exceptional?</p>
      <p>Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it's so
         great it tells you the whole story in just three words: We the people.
         In those other constitutions, the Government tells the people of those
         countries what they're allowed to do. In our Constitution, we the people
         tell the Government what it can do, and it can do only those things
         listed in that document and no others. Virtually every other revolution
         in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of
         rulers. Our revolution is the first to say the people are the masters
         and government is their servant. And you young people out there, don't
         ever forget that. Someday you could be in this room, but wherever you
         are, America is depending on you to reach your highest and be your
         best--because here in America, we the people are in charge.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Just three words: We the people--those are the kids on Christmas Day
            looking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in Korea or
            aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. A million miles from
            home, but doing their duty.</span></p>
      <p>We the people--those are the warmhearted whose numbers we can't begin to
         count, who'll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will
         never know and MIA families they will never meet. Why? Because that's
         the way we are, this unique breed we call Americans.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We the people--they're farmers on tough times, but who never stop
            feeding a hungry world.</span> They're the volunteers at the hospital choking
         back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling
         for life because of a mother who used drugs. And you'll forgive me a
         special memory--it's a million mothers like Nelle Reagan who never knew
         a stranger or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door.</p>
      <p>We the people--they refute last week's television commentary downgrading
         our optimism and our idealism. They are the entrepreneurs, the builders,
         the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks--the true heroes of our land
         who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history. You know
         they're Americans because their spirit is as big as the universe and
         their hearts are bigger than their spirits.</p>
      <p>We the people--starting the third century of a dream and standing up to
         some cynic who's trying to tell us we're not going to get any better.
         Are we at the end? Well, I can't tell it any better than the real
         thing--a story recorded by James Madison from the final moments of the
         Constitutional Convention, September 17th, 1787. As the last few members
         signed the document, Benjamin Franklin--the oldest delegate at 81 years
         and in frail health--looked over toward the chair where George
         Washington daily presided. At the back of the chair was painted the
         picture of a Sun on the horizon. And turning to those sitting next to
         him, Franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting
         to distinguish between a rising and a setting Sun.</p>
      <p>Well, I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting
         around Franklin--leaning in to listen more closely to him. And then Dr.
         Franklin began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of
         their efforts, and this is what he said: "I have often looked at that
         picture behind the President without being able to tell whether it was a
         rising or setting Sun: But now at length I have the happiness to know
         that it is a rising and not a setting Sun." Well, you can bet it's
         rising because, my fellow citizens, America isn't finished. Her best
         days have just begun.</p>
      <p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The President spoke at 9:03 p.m. in the House Chamber of the
         Capitol. He was introduced by Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of
         Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and
         television.

      <h3>January 25, 1988</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and
         Senate: When we first met here 7 years ago--many of us for the first
         time--it was with the hope of beginning something new for America. We
         meet here tonight in this historic Chamber to continue that work. If
         anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my
         administration, I say let's leave that to history; we're not finished
         yet. So, my message to you tonight is put on your work shoes; we're
         still on the job.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">History records the power of the ideas that brought us here those 7
            years ago--ideas like the individual's right to reach as far and as high
            as his or her talents will permit; the free market as an engine of
            economic progress. </span>And as an ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao-tzu, said:
         "Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo
         it." Well, these ideas were part of a larger notion, a vision, if you
         will, of America herself--an America not only rich in opportunity for
         the individual but an America, too, of strong families and vibrant
         neighborhoods; an America whose divergent but harmonizing communities
         were a reflection of a deeper community of values: the value of work, of
         family, of religion, and of the love of freedom that God places in each
         of us and whose defense He has entrusted in a special way to this
         nation.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev
            was here--the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to
            humankind began with three simple words:</span> "We the People," the
         revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights, and
         not the other way around. And there's one lesson that has come home
         powerfully to me, which I would offer to you now. Just as those who
         created this Republic pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes,
         and their sacred honor, so, too, America's leaders today must pledge to
         each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what
         is best for ourselves or for our party but what is best for America.</p>
      <p>In the spirit of Jefferson, let us affirm that in this Chamber tonight
         there are no Republicans, no Democrats--just Americans. Yes, we will
         have our differences, but let us always remember what unites us far
         outweighs whatever divides us. Those who sent us here to serve them--the
         millions of Americans watching and listening tonight--expect this of us.
         Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an
         election year. <span class="economy"><span class="poverty">We've done this before. And as we have worked together to
               bring down spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to
               record heights; America has created more jobs and better, higher paying
               jobs; family income has risen for 4 straight years, and America's poor
               climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">Our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an
               economic and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives,
               growth, and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private
               sector initiatives and a 77-percent increase in charitable giving; a
               revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and
               restored the American dream.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In international relations, too, there's only one description for what,
            together, we have achieved: a complete turnabout, a revolution. Seven
            years ago, America was weak, and freedom everywhere was under siege.
            Today America is strong, and democracy is everywhere on the move. From
            Central America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic
            reforms and human rights are taking hold. We've replaced "Blame America"
            with "Look up to America."</span> <span class="war">We've rebuilt our defenses. And of all our
            accomplishments, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that
            our young people are again proud to wear our country's uniform.</span></p>
      <p>And in a few moments, I'm going to talk about three developments--arms
         reduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic
         revolution--that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would
         have dared imagine 7 years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two
         great nightmares of the postwar era. I speak of the startling hope of
         giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear
         terror.</p>
      <p>Tonight, then, we're strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. This
         is the state of our Union. And if we will work together this year, I
         believe we can give a future President and a future Congress the chance
         to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom not just the state of
         our Union but the state of our world.</p>
      <p>Toward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. <span class="economy">First, steps we
            can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our
            children a future of low inflation and full employment.</span> Second, let's
         check our progress in attacking social problems, where important gains
         have been made, but which still need critical attention. <span class="economy"><span class="poverty">I mean schools
               that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for
               family life and family values.</span></span> <span class="diplomacy">Our third objective tonight is global:
            continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen
            around the world.</span> <span class="war">Fourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace
            for nearly a decade and a half, as we move toward our goals of world
            prosperity and world freedom. We must protect that peace and deter war
            by making sure the next President inherits what you and I have a moral
            obligation to give that President: a national security that is
            unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new
            technology and is fully funded.</span></p>
      <p>This is a full agenda. It's meant to be. You see, my thinking on the
         next year is quite simple: Let's make this the best of 8. And that means
         it's all out--right to the finish line. I don't buy the idea that this
         is the last year of anything, because we're not talking here tonight
         about registering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our
         successes. And that's why our focus is the values, the principles, and
         ideas that made America great. Let's be clear on this point. We're for
         limited government, because we understand, as the Founding Fathers did,
         that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the
         individual so that every American of every race and region shares fully
         in the flowering of American prosperity and freedom.</p>
      <p>One other thing we Americans like--the future--like the sound of it, the
         idea of it, the hope of it. <span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">Where others fear trade and economic growth,
               we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of
               opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond.</span></span> Where others seek
         to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down. Where others take
         counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes. Yes, we Americans like the
         future and like making the most of it. Let's do that now.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">And let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by
            controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of Federal deficits.
            We have had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years. For
            the first time in 14 years, the Federal Government spent less in real
            terms last year than the year before. We took $73 billion off last
            year's deficit compared to the year before. The deficit itself has moved
            from 6.3 percent of the gross national product to only 3.4 percent. And
            perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our
            view of deficits. You know, a few of us can remember when, not too many
            years ago, those who created the deficits said they would make us
            prosperous and not to worry about the debt, because we owe it to
            ourselves.</span> Well, at last there is agreement that we can't spend
         ourselves rich.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our recent budget agreement, designed to reduce Federal deficits by $76
            billion over the next 2 years, builds on this consensus.</span> But this
         agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the
         past: more broken promises and more unchecked spending. As I indicated
         in my first State of the Union, what ails us can be simply put: The
         Federal Government is too big, and it spends too much money. I can
         assure you, the bipartisan leadership of Congress, of my help in
         fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement. And this includes
         the swift and certain use of the veto power.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, it's also time for some plain talk about the most immediate
            obstacle to controlling Federal deficits. The simple but frustrating
            problem of making expenses match revenues--something American families
            do and the Federal Government can't--has caused crisis after crisis in
            this city. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, I will say to you tonight what I
            have said before and will continue to say: The budget process has broken
            down; it needs a drastic overhaul.</span> With each ensuing year, the spectacle
         before the American people is the same as it was this Christmas: budget
         deadlines delayed or missed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions
         that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one
         bill, and a Federal Government on the brink of default.</p>
      <p>I know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said, because you
         suffered so directly. But let's recall that in 7 years, of 91
         appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date,
         only 10 made it on time. Last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due
         by October 1st, none of them made it. Instead, we had four continuing
         resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and 2 days, and 3 days,
         respectively.</p>
      <p>And then, along came these behemoths. This is the conference
         report--1,053 pages, report weighing 14 pounds. Then this--a
         reconciliation bill 6 months late that was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15
         pounds. And the long-term continuing resolution--this one was 2 months
         late, and it's 1,057 pages long, weighing 14 pounds. That was a total of
         43 pounds of paper and ink. You had 3 hours--yes, 3 hours--to consider
         each, and it took 300 people at my Office of Management and Budget just
         to read the bill so the Government wouldn't shut down. Congress
         shouldn't send another one of these. No, and if you do, I will not sign
         it.</p>
      <p>Let's change all this. Instead of a Presidential budget that gets
         discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced,
         why not a simple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the
         spending priorities within the available revenues? And let's remember
         our deadline is October 1st, not Christmas. Let's get the people's work
         done in time to avoid a footrace with Santa Claus. And, yes, this
         year--to coin a phrase--a new beginning: 13 individual bills, on time
         and fully reviewed by Congress.</p>
      <p>I'm also certain you join me in saying: Let's help ensure our future of
         prosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will not get to
         use it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must have. Give
         the President the same authority that 43 Governors use in their States:
         the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the
         waste, and enforce budget discipline. Let's approve the line-item veto.</p>
      <p>And let's take a partial step in this direction. Most of you in this
         Chamber didn't know what was in this catchall bill and report. Over the
         past few weeks, we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little
         comma here and there. For example, there's millions for items such as
         cranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the
         commercialization of wildflowers. <span class="diplomacy">And that's not to mention the five or
            so million ($.5 million) that--so that people from developing nations
            could come here to watch Congress at work. I won't even touch that. So,
            tonight I offer you this challenge. </span>In 30 days I will send back to you
         those items as rescissions, which if I had the authority to line them
         out I would do so.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, review this multibillion-dollar package that will not undercut our
            bipartisan budget agreement. As a matter of fact, if adopted, it will
            improve our deficit reduction goals. And what an example we can set,
            that we're serious about getting our financial accounts in order.</span> By
         acting and approving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a
         congressional process that is out of control.</p>
      <p>There is another vital reform. <span class="economy">Yes, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings has been
            profoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and
            make it permanent. Let us do now what so many States do to hold down
            spending and what 32 State legislatures have asked us to do. Let us heed
            the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of Americans and pass a
            constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the
            Federal Government to live within its means. </span>Reform of the budget
         process--including the line-item veto and balanced budget
         amendment--will, together with real restraint on government spending,
         prevent the Federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget.</p>
      <p>Let's ensure that the Federal Government never again legislates against
         the family and the home. Last September 1 signed an Executive order on
         the family requiring that every department and agency review its
         activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm
         the family. But let us make certain that the family is always at the
         center of the public policy process not just in this administration but
         in all future administrations. It's time for Congress to consider, at
         the beginning, a statement of the impact that legislation will have on
         the basic unit of American society, the family.</p>
      <p>And speaking of the family, let's turn to a matter on the mind of every
         American parent tonight: education. We all know the sorry story of the
         sixties and seventies--soaring spending, plummeting test scores--and
         that hopeful trend of the eighties, when we replaced an obsession with
         dollars with a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up.
         There's a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a
         hundred times: In a child's education, money can never take the place of
         basics like discipline, hard work, and, yes, homework.</p>
      <p>As a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education--more than we
         spend on defense. Yet across our country, Governors like New Jersey's
         Tom Kean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as
         important as how much we spend. Opening up the teaching profession to
         all qualified candidates, merit pay--so that good teachers get A's as
         well as apples--and stronger curriculum, as Secretary Bennett has
         proposed for high schools--these imaginative reforms are making common
         sense the most popular new kid in America's schools. How can we help?
         Well, we can talk about and push for these reforms. But the most
         important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools
         belongs to the States, local communities and, most of all, to the
         parents and teachers.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">My friends, some years ago, the Federal Government declared war on
            poverty, and poverty won.</span> <span class="poverty">Today the Federal Government has 59 major
            welfare programs and spends more than $100 billion a year on them. What
            has all this money done? Well, too often it has only made poverty harder
            to escape. Federal welfare programs have created a massive social
            problem. With the best of intentions, government created a poverty trap
            that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift
            themselves out of poverty: the family.</span> Dependency has become the one
         enduring heirloom, passed from one generation to the next, of too many
         fragmented families.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">It is time--this may be the most radical thing I've said in 7 years in
            this office--it's time for Washington to show a little humility. There
            are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 States and a thousand communities
            around the Nation. It is time to nurture them and see which ones can
            catch fire and become guiding lights. States have begun to show us the
            way. They've demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built
            around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative
            programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work. Let
            us give the States more flexibility and encourage more reforms. Let's
            start making our welfare system the first rung on America's ladder of
            opportunity, a boost up from dependency, not a graveyard but a
            birthplace of hope.</span></p>
      <p>And now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and
         the quality of family life. The first is an untold American success
         story. Recently, we released our annual survey of what graduating high
         school seniors have to say about drugs. Cocaine use is declining, and
         marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began. We can be proud that
         our students are just saying no to drugs. But let us remember what this
         menace requires: commitment from every part of America and every single
         American, a commitment to a drugfree America. The war against drugs is a
         war of individual battles, a crusade with many heroes, including
         America's young people and also someone very special to me. She has
         helped so many of our young people to say no to drugs. Nancy, much
         credit belongs to you, and I want to express to you your husband's pride
         and your country's thanks.'. Surprised you, didn't I?</p>
      <p>Well, now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to
         confront. Tonight, I call America--a good nation, a moral people--to
         charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion
         on demand. To those who say this violates a woman's right to control of
         her own body: Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the
         unborn child is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the
         pursuit of happiness? Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn
         with legislation that would stop all Federal funding for abortion and
         with a human life amendment making, of course, an exception where the
         unborn child threatens the life of the mother. Our Judeo-Christian
         tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense. But
         with that one exception, let us look to those others in our land who cry
         out for children to adopt. I pledge to you tonight I will work to remove
         barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions
         of Americans so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families
         who want them and love them.</p>
      <p>And let me add here: So many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us
         that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation's health and
         vigor. The Congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the Supreme
         Court, with an acknowledgment of the Supreme Being. Yet we are denied
         the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who
         wish to pray. I believe Congress should pass our school prayer
         amendment.</p>
      <p>Now, to make sure there is a full nine member Supreme Court to interpret
         the law, to protect the rights of all Americans, I urge the Senate to
         move quickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the
         highest Court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to
         fill vacancies in the Federal judiciary.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">Here then are our domestic priorities. Yet if the Congress and the
               administration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to
               expand a growing world economy, to continue to reduce the threat of
               nuclear arms, and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of
               democratic institutions.</span></span></p>
      <p>Our policies consistently received the strongest support of the late
         Congressman Dan Daniel of Virginia. I'm sure all of you join me in
         expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the
            world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth. A creative,
            competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars
            that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of
            jobs. We should always remember: <span class="diplomacy">Protectionism is destructionism.
               America's jobs, America's growth, America's future depend on
               trade--trade that is free, open, and fair.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">This year, we have it within our power to take a major step toward a
               growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches
               to all the free nations of this Earth. I'm speaking of the historic free
               trade agreement negotiated between our country and Canada. And I can
               also tell you that we're determined to expand this concept, south as
               well as north. Next month I will be traveling to Mexico, where trade
               matters will be of foremost concern. And over the next several months,
               our Congress and the Canadian Parliament can make the start of such a
               North American accord a reality.</span></span> Our goal must be a day when the free
         flow of trade, from the tip of Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle,
         unites the people of the Western Hemisphere in a bond of mutually
         beneficial exchange, when all borders become what the U.S.-Canadian
         border so long has been: a meeting place rather than a dividing line.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is
            indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and
            against totalitarian rule. This global democratic revolution has removed
            the specter, so frightening a decade ago, of democracy doomed to
            permanent minority status in the world. In South and Central America,
            only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976.</span> Today over
         90 percent of Latin Americans live in nations committed to democratic
         principles. And the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous
         people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of
         their own destiny.</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="civil-rights">In Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning, because that nation is so
               near our own borders. The recent revelations of a former high-level
               Sandinista major, Roger Miranda, show us that, even as they talk peace,
               the Communist Sandinista government of Nicaragua has established plans
               for a large 600,000-man army. Yet even as these plans are made, the
               Sandinista regime knows the tide is turning, and the cause of Nicaraguan
               freedom is riding at its crest. Because of the freedom fighters, who are
               resisting Communist rule, the Sandinistas have been forced to extend
               some democratic rights, negotiate with church authorities, and release a
               few political prisoners.</span></span></p>
      <p>The focus is on the Sandinistas, their promises and their actions. There
         is a consensus among the four Central American democratic Presidents
         that the Sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and
         democracy to all of Central America. The Sandinistas again have promised
         reforms. Their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy.
         On Wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be
         submitted, which reflects our mutual desire for peace, freedom, and
         democracy in Nicaragua. I ask Congress to pass this request. Let us be
         for the people of Nicaragua what Lafayette, Pulaski, and Von Steuben
         were for our forefathers and the cause of American independence.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">So, too, in Afghanistan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace. We
            support the Mujahidin. There can be no settlement unless all Soviet
            troops are removed and the Afghan people are allowed genuine
            self-determination. I have made my views on this matter known to Mr.
            Gorbachev. But not just Nicaragua or Afghanistan--yes, everywhere we see
            a swelling freedom tide across the world: freedom fighters rising up in
            Cambodia and Angola, fighting and dying for the same democratic
            liberties we hold sacred. Their cause is our cause: freedom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Yet even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace
            and reduce the danger of nuclear war. But let's have no illusions. Three
            years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment
            have increased the risk of our most basic security interests,
            jeopardizing earlier hard-won goals. We must face squarely the
            implications of this negative trend and make adequate, stable defense
            spending a top goal both this year and in the future.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">This same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs
               as well. But the resolve of America and its NATO allies has opened the
               way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction. Our recently signed
               INF treaty is historic, because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes
               the most stringent verification regime in arms control history,
               including several forms of short-notice, on-site inspection. I submitted
               the treaty today, and I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent
               to ratification of this landmark agreement.</span></span> Thank you very much.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In addition to the INF treaty, we're within reach of an even more
            significant START agreement that will reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range
            missile--or strategic arsenals by half. But let me be clear.</span> Our
         approach is not to seek agreement for agreement's sake but to settle
         only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of
         our allies. We will never put our security at risk--or that of our
         allies--just to reach an agreement with the Soviets. No agreement is
         better than a bad agreement.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">As I mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what
            we never had--a future free of nuclear terror. Reduction of strategic
            offensive arms is one step, SDI another. Our funding request for our
            Strategic Defense Initiative is less than 2 percent of the total defense
            budget. SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent.
            SDI has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction.
            It reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all
            mankind. Strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a
            safer, more stable basis for deterrence</span>. We must also remember that SDI
         is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident, a Chernobyl of the
         sky, or an accidental launch or some madman who might come along.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="civil-rights">We've seen such changes in the world in 7 years. As totalitarianism
               struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance
               and the aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are
               resilient and resurgent.</span></span> As the global democratic revolution has put
         totalitarianism on the defensive, we have left behind the days of
         retreat. America is again a vigorous leader of the free world, a nation
         that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and
         vital interests. No legacy would make me more proud than leaving in
         place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus
         that prevents a paralysis of American power from ever occurring again.</p>
      <p>But my thoughts tonight go beyond this, and I hope you'll let me end
         this evening with a personal reflection. You know, the world could never
         be quite the same again after Jacob Shallus, a trustworthy and
         dependable clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, took his pen and
         engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of
         our Constitution. And in a quiet but final way, the course of human
         events was forever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the Emmitsburg
         Pike in an obscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke of
         our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish
         from the Earth.</p>
      <p>At the start of this decade, I suggested that we live in equally
         momentous times, that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of
         government would endure and whether history still had a place of
         greatness for a quiet, pleasant, greening land called America. Not
         everything has been made perfect in 7 years, nor will it be made perfect
         in seven times 70 years, but before us, this year and beyond, are great
         prospects for the cause of peace and world freedom.</p>
      <p>It means, too, that the young Americans I spoke of 7 years ago, as well
         as those who might be coming along the Virginia or Maryland shores this
         night and seeing for the first time the lights of this Capital City--the
         lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the
         monuments to the memory of our great men--it means those young Americans
         will find a city of hope in a land that is free.</p>
      <p>We can be proud that for them and for us, as those lights along the
         Potomac are still seen this night signaling as they have for nearly two
         centuries and as we pray God they always will, that another generation
         of Americans has protected and passed on lovingly this place called
         America, this shining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for
         the people.</p>
      <p>Thank you, and God bless you.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The President spoke at 9:07 p.m. in the House Chamber of the
         Capitol. He was introduced by Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of

         television.

      <h3>January 31, 1990</h3>
      <p>Tonight, I come not to speak about the "State of the Government", not to
         detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe
         every line in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American
         people about the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've
         seen, the challenges we face. And what that means for America.</p>
      <p>There are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes
         before from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have
         lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were
         defined in 1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of
         nations, the pace of progress, freedom or oppression for millions of
         people around the world.</p>
      <p>Nineteen Forty-Five provided the common frame of reference the compass
         points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. And
         that was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the
         Revolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that
         it marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.</p>
      <p>Think back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew
         as 1989 began.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">One year, one year ago the people of Panama lived in fear under the
            thumb of a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">"Operation Just Cause" has achieved its objective. And the number of
            military personel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the
            operation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of
            February the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and
            women of our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back
            home.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared he was ready to open a
            dialogue with the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the
            future of a free Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead
            the Polish government.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a
            prisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of
            Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his
            guide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years.
            And today, less than one year later, it's the wall that's history.</span></p>
      <p>Remarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held
         hopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding
         goals of American policy, a policy based upon a single shining
         principle: the cause of freedom.</p>
      <p>America, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of the
         people, everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the
         center of a widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the
         next century.</p>
      <p>Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on
         these shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation,
         this idea called America was and always will be a new world, our new
         world.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">At a workers' rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague
            the idea called America is alive.</span> <span class="civil-rights">A worker, dressed in grimy overalls,
            rises to speak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his
            fellow citizens with these words, words of a distant revolution: "We
            hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal,
            that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,
            and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
            It's no secret here at home freedom's door opened long ago. The
            cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place:
            democracy, competition, opportunity, private investment, stewardship,
            and of course, leadership.</span></p>
      <p>And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a
         system second to none, and make it better:</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A better America where there's a job for whoever wants one;</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Where women working outside the home can be confident their children are
            in safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child
            alternatives for parents.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong
            economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Where "Made in the USA" is recognized around the world as the symbol of
            quality and progress,</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work
            and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the
            American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the
            help they need to live in dignity.</span></p>
      <p>Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and
         every one of them makes the grade,</p>
      <p>Where every street, every city, every school and every child is
         drug-free.</p>
      <p>And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go
         out to our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and
         in our efforts. That's part of the future we want to see, the future we
         can make for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to
         extend our horizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the
         future starts today.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the
            great challenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can
            succeed in the global economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that
            challenge we must make some fundamental changes, some crucial
            investments in ourselves.</span></p>
      <p>Yes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is
         determined to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds.
         <span class="infra">Physical capital: everything from our farms and factories to our
            workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce and
            deliver quality goods and quality services.</span> Intellectual, intellectual
         capital: the source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products. <span class="economy">And of
            course human capital: the talented work force that we'll need to compete
            in the global market.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit
            of American ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN
            worker, that would be bad. The American worker is the most productive
            worker in the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new
            investments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that's the idea
            behind the new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will
            send to Congress tomorrow.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage
            risk-takers, especially those in small businesses, to take those steps
            that translate into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of
            us.</span></p>
      <p>We'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget
         commitment is there. The money is there. It's there for research and
         development, R and D, a record high. It's there for our housing
         initiative, hope, H-O-P-E, to help everyone from first-time homebuyers
         to the homeless. The money's there to keep our kids drug-free, 70
         percent more than when I took office in 1989. It's there for space
         exploration, and its there for education, another record high.</p>
      <p>And one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the
         governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids
         are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And
         I've made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in
         funds, an extra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all
         of us: Head Start.</p>
      <p>Education is the one investment that means more for our future, because
         it means the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is
         not simply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more,
         expecting more, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our
         parents and of ourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why
         tonight, I am announcing America's education goals, goals developed with
         enormous cooperation from the nation's governors. And if I might I'd
         like to say I'm very pleased that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton,
         Governor Branstad, Governor Campbell, all of whom were very key in these
         discussion, these deliberations, are with us here tonight.</p>
      <p>By the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn.
         The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no
         less than 90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools'
         diplomas mean something. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth,
         and 12th grades, we must assess our students' performance.</p>
      <p>By the, by the year 2000 U.S. students must be the first in the world in
         math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled,
         literate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of
         disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn.
         And every school in America must be drug-free.</p>
      <p>Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at
         stake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in
         education.</p>
      <p>These investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this
         about the American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our
         ingenuity, our energy, our experience, and technology our spirit and
         enterprise against anyone. But let the competition be free, but let it
         also be fair. America is ready.</p>
      <p>Since we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to
         meet our challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made
         real progress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our
         gross national product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days
         ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.</p>
      <p>That budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the
         Gramm-Rudman target. It brings the deficit down further. And balances
         the budget by 1993, with no new taxes.</p>
      <p>And let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending.
         For most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.</p>
      <p>And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family
         must when it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and
         grandchildren. Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national
         debt.</p>
      <p>And there's something more, and there's something more we owe the
         generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's
         precious environmental inheritance.</p>
      <p>As just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the
         Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more
         bureaucracy, not more red tape, but the certainty that here at home, and
         especially in our dealings with other nations, environmental issues have
         the status they deserve.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect
            our environment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a
            new initiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks
            and wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public
            lands.</span></p>
      <p>And something else, something that will help keep this country clean,
         from our forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for
         generations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.</p>
      <p>And tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the
         Congress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is
         work to do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the
         spirit of cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work
         together to do the will of the people--clean air, child care, the
         educational excellence act, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm
         bill, transportation policy, product liability reform, enterprise zones.
         It's time to act together.</p>
      <p>And there's one thing I hope we can agree on. It's about our
         commitments. And I'm talking about Social Security.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American
            supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they
            retire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We, we rescued the system in 1983 and it's sound again, bipartisan
            arrangement. Our budget fully funds today's benefits and it assures that
            future benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do
            is mess around with Social Security.</span></p>
      <p>There's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful
         consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under
         way now. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan,
         Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy
         Council review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost
         of our nation's health care system. I am committed to bring the
         staggering costs of health care under control.</p>
      <p>The State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this
         very chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We
         must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions
         of individuals. And I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings
         across this country. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism,
         anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right
         now. Every single one of us.</p>
      <p>The State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim
         the problems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when
         there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a
         stranger in need. We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit
         down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along
         the values we had as children. And that's how we sustain the State of
         the Union.</p>
      <p>Every effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that
         give democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.</p>
      <p>And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long
         as we live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain
         sound and strong.</p>
      <p>And to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to
         listen to parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class
         James Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th
         Rangers. It's dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into
         action in Panama. It's a letter servicemen write--and hope will never,
         ever be sent. And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this
         letter. She passed it on to me out there in Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>And here is some of what he wrote: "I've never been afraid of death, but
         I know he is waiting at the corner...I've been trained to kill and to
         save, and so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the
         fog, and yet... do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died
         to give you... But most of all, don't forget that the Army was my
         choice. Something that I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to
         serve my country and inure that you are free to do what you want and to
         live your lives freely."</p>
      <p>Let me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in
         Panama, and among the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He
         carried the idea we call America in his heart.</p>
      <p>I began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year.
         There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And
         there is a need for leadership that only America can provide.</p>
      <p>Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President
         Harry Truman predicted such a time would come. He said, "As our world
         grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the
         Iron Curtain, <span class="diplomacy">then inevitably there will come a time of change within
            the Communist world." Today, that change is taking place.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">For more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check
            and insured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with
            Communism crumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy's advance, to
            take the lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope, a great and
            growing commonwealth of free nations.</span></p>
      <p>And to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a
         new consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world
         we want to see.</p>
      <p>Here in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the
         Americas, North and South, to live in freedom.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In the Far East and Africa, it's time for the full flowering of free
            governments and free markets that have served the engine of progress.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern
            Europe so that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a
            future whole and free.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">It's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to
            endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward
            democracy and economic opportunity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great
            uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is
            diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization.
            And, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization
            and the Strategic Defense Initiative.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control
            agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in
            Europe, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue
            to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I've consulted with
            leaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just
            today.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And I agree with our European allies that an American military presence
            in Europe is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the
            Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing
            a major new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in
            Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">This number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior
            military advisers. It's designed to protect American and European
            interests and sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our
            arms control talks--conventional, chemical and strategic--must now be
            our goal. And that time has come.</span></p>
      <p>Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the
         world tonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities
         and opposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be
         served by an America strong enough and sure enough to defend our
         interests and our ideals. It's this American idea that for the past four
         decades helped inspire the Revolution of '89.</p>
      <p>And here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and
         history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I
         stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to
         the fallen workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty.
         Three tall crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an
         anchor, an ancient symbol of hope.</p>
      <p>The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of
         change, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very
         heart of the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on
         every one of us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.</p>
      <p>In the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was
         blessed once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became
         our 12th grandchild. When I held the little guy for the first time, the
         troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in
         perspective.</p>
      <p>And now I know, I know you're probably thinking, Well, that's just a
         grandfather talking.</p>
      <p>Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year
         across this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to
         Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The
         budding young environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in
         exploring the Florida Everglades. <span class="diplomacy">The Little Leaguers I played catch
            with in Poland, ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series.</span> And even
         the kids who are ill or alone--and God bless those boarder babies, born
         addicted to drugs and AIDS--coping with problems no child should have to
         face. But, you know, when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is
         the same: full of dreams, ready to take on the world, all special
         because they are the very future of freedom. And to them belongs this
         new world I've been speaking about.</p>
      <p>And so tonight, I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Now let
         me start with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are
         our living link with the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of
         struggles waged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for
         freedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well, because every
         American has a story to tell.</p>
      <p>And parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell
         them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach
         them that of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most
         precious legacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the
         greatest is helping others.</p>
      <p>And to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests
         our hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix
         your vision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on
         the destiny that is yours and yours alone.</p>
      <p>And finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the
         symbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegiance to this idea we call
         America. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon
         each and every one of us.</p>
      <p>God bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United
         States of America.
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_29,_1991" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>George H.W. Bush</h2>
      <h3>January 29, 1991</h3>
      <p>Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress.</p>
      <p>I come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans,
         certain we stand at a defining hour.</p>
      <p>Halfway around the world, we are engaged in a great struggle in the
         skies and on the seas and sands. We know why we're there. We are
         Americans--part of something larger than ourselves.</p>
      <p>For two centuries we've done the hard work of freedom. And tonight we
         lead the world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea--a new
            world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to
            achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security,
            freedom, and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle,
            and worthy of our children's future.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel
            lawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion--his ruthless,
            systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor--violated everything the
            community of nations holds dear. The world has said this aggression
            would not stand, and it will not stand.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Together, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism and
            isolation that gives temptation to tyrants. The world has answered
            Saddam's invasion with 12 United Nations resolutions, starting with a
            demand for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal, and backed up
            by forces from 28 countries of six continents. With few exceptions, the
            world now stands as one.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity. A year and
            a half ago, in Germany, I said our goal was a Europe whole and free.
            Tonight, Germany is united. Europe has become whole and free, and
            America's leadership was instrumental in making it possible.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The principle that has guided us is simple: our objective is to help the
            Baltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet
            Union. In our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership we have been
            given representations, which, if fulfilled, would result in the
            withdrawal of some Soviet forces, a re-opening of dialogue with the
            republics, and a move away from violence.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We will watch carefully as the situation develops. And we will maintain
            our contact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment
            to democratization and reform.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">If it is possible, I want to continue to build a lasting basis for
            U.S.-Soviet cooperation, for a more peaceful future for all mankind.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The triumph of democratic ideas in Eastern Europe and Latin America, and
            the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere around the world all
            confirm the wisdom of our nation's founders.</span></p>
      <p>Tonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and
         savage aggression.</p>
      <p>We in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th Century thankful for
         all our blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties
         and responsive to our duties at home and around the world.</p>
      <p>For two centuries, America has served the world as an inspiring example
         of freedom and democracy. For generations, America has led the struggle
         to preserve and extend the blessings of liberty. And today, in a rapidly
         changing world, American leadership is indispensable. Americans know
         that leadership brings burdens, and requires sacrifice.</p>
      <p>But we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us. We are Americans;
         we have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom. And when
         we do, freedom works.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The conviction and courage we see in the Persian Gulf today is simply
            the American character in action.</span> The indomitable spirit that is
         contributing to this victory for world peace and justice is the same
         spirit that gives us the power and the potential to meet our challenges
         at home.</p>
      <p>We are resolute and resourceful. If we can selflessly confront evil for
         the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this
         land all it should be.</p>
      <p>If anyone tells you America's best days are behind her, they're looking
         the wrong way.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I come before this house, and the American people, with an
         appeal for renewal. This is not merely a call for new government
         initiatives, it is a call for new initiative in government, in our
         communities, and from every American--to prepare for the next American
         century.</p>
      <p>America has always led by example. So who among us will set this
         example? Which of our citizens will lead us in this next American
         century? Everyone who steps forward today, to get one addict off drugs;
         to convince one troubled teen-ager not to give up on life; to comfort
         one AIDS patient; to help one hungry child.</p>
      <p>We have within our reach the promise of renewed America. We can find
         meaning and reward by serving some purpose higher than ourselves--a
         shining purpose, the illumination of a thousand points of light. It is
         expressed by all who know the irresistible force of a child's hand, of a
         friend who stands by you and stays there--a volunteer's generous
         gesture, an idea that is simply right.</p>
      <p>The problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them
         remains the same: it is the individual--the individual who steps
         forward. And the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to
         the other: the sum of our friendships, marriages, families and
         communities.</p>
      <p>We all have something to give. So if you know how to read, find someone
         who can't. If you've got a hammer, find a nail. If you're not hungry,
         not lonely, not in trouble--seek out someone who is.</p>
      <p>Join the community of conscience. Do the hard work of freedom. That will
         define the state of our Union.</p>
      <p>Since the birth of our nation, "we the people" has been the source of
         our strength. What government can do alone is limited, but the potential
         of the American people knows no limits.</p>
      <p>We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism. We are
         Americans. We are the nation that believes in the future. We are the
         nation that can shape the future.</p>
      <p>And we've begun to do just that, by strengthening the power and choice
         of individuals and families.</p>
      <p>Together, these last two years, we've put dollars for child care
         directly in the hands of patients instead of bureaucracies, unshackled
         the potential of Americans with disabilities, applied the creativity of
         the marketplace in the service of the environment, for clean air, and
         made homeownership possible for more Americans.</p>
      <p>The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy, it is in the people
         and their communities. In everything we do, let us unleash the potential
         of our most precious resource--our citizens. We must return to families,
         communities, counties, cities, states and institutions of every kind,
         the power to chart their own destiny, and the freedom and opportunity
         provided by strong economic growth. That's what America is all about.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I know, tonight, in some regions of our country, people are in genuine
            economic distress. I hear them.</span></p>
      <p>Earlier this month Kathy Blackwell of Massachusetts wrote me about what
         can happen when the economy slows down, saying, "My heart is aching, and
         I think that you should know--your people out here are hurting badly."</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I understand. And I'm not unrealistic about the future. But there are
            reasons to be optimistic about our economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, we don't have to fight double-digit inflation. Second, most
            industries won't have to make big cuts in production because they don't
            have big inventories piled up. And third, our exports are running solid
            and strong. In fact, American businesses are exporting at a record rate.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">So let's put these times in perspective. Together, since 1981, we've
            created almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half and cut interest
            rates in half.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Yes, the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been
            temporarily interrupted. But our economy is still over twice as large as
            our closest competitor.</span></p>
      <p>We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon. We will
         get on our way to a new record of expansion, and achieve the competitive
         strength that will carry us into the next American century.</p>
      <p>We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth,
         investing in the future and giving power and opportunity to the
         individual.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must begin with control of Federal spending. That's why I'm
            submitting a budget that holds the growth in spending to less than the
            rate of inflation. And that's why, amid all the sound and fury of last
            year's budget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps so
            that future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding
            war.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Though controversial, the budget agreement finally put the Federal
            Government on a pay-as-you-go basis, and cut the growth of debt by
            nearly $500 billion. And that frees funds for saving and job-creating
            investment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, let's do more. My budget again includes tax-free family savings
            accounts; penalty-free withdrawals from I. R. A.'s for first-time
            homebuyers; and, to increase jobs and growth, a reduced tax for
            long-term capital gains.</span></p>
      <p>I know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects
         of a capital gains incentive. So tonight I am asking the Congressional
         leaders and the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by
         Chairman Alan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that
         we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the
            future, they must also be matched by long-term investments for the next
            American century.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">That requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that's exactly what
            we will be sending to the Congress. We have prepared a detailed series
            of proposals, that include: A budget that promotes investment in
            America's future--in children, education, infrastructure, space and high
            technology. Legislation to achieve excellence in education, building on
            the partnership forged with the 50 governors at the education summit,
            enabling parents to choose their children's schools and helping to make
            America No. 1 in math and science. A blueprint for a new national
            highway system, a critical investment in our transportation
            infrastructure. A research and development agenda that includes record
            levels of Federal investment and a permanent tax credit to strengthen
            private R and D and create jobs. A comprehensive national energy
            strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency, increased
            development and greater use of alternative fuels. A banking reform plan
            to bring America's financial system into the 21st Century, so that our
            banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make job-creating loans
            for our factories, businesses, and homebuyers. I do think there has been
            too much pessimism. Sound banks should be making more sound loans, now.
            And interest rates should be lower, now. In addition to these proposals,
            we must recognize that our economic strength depends upon being
            competitive in world markets. We must continue to expand America's
            exports. A successful Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations will
            create more real jobs, and more real growth, for all nations. You and I
            know that if the playing field is level, America's workers and farmers
            can outwork and outproduce anyone, anytime, anywhere.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And with the Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for the
            Americas Initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies
            and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more
            power and opportunity in the hands of the individual. That means new
            incentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment
            through enterprise zones. It also means tenant control and ownership of
            public housing. Freedom and the power to choose should not be the
            privilege of wealth. They are the birthright of every American.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity. Every one
            of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry, and
            hate. We will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes,
            and I will once again press the Congress to strengthen the laws against
            employment discrimination without resorting to the use of unfair
            preferences.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We're determined to protect another fundamental civil right: freedom
            from crime and the fear that stalks our cities. The Attorney General
            will soon convene a crime summit of the nation's law-enforcement
            officials. And to help us support them we need a tough crime control
            legislation, and we need it now.</span></p>
      <p>As we fight crime, we will fully implement our nation strategy for
         combatting drug abuse. Recent data show we are making progress, but much
         remains to be done. We will not rest until the day of the dealer is
         over, forever.</p>
      <p>Good health care is every American's right and every American's
         responsibility. So we are proposing an aggression program of new
         prevention initiatives--for infants, for children, for adults, and for
         the elderly-- to promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from
         spiraling.</p>
      <p>It's time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal
         of the citizen politician who comes not to stay, but to serve. One of
         the reasons there is so much support for term limitations is that the
         American people are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in
         politics. We must look beyond the next election, to the next generation.
         The time has come to put the national interest ahead of the special
         interest--and totally eliminate political action committees.</p>
      <p>That would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the
         hands of individuals. And where power cannot be put directly into the
         hands of the individual, it should be moved closer to the people--away
         from Washington.</p>
      <p>The federal government too often treats government programs as if they
         are of Washington, by Washington, and for Washington. Once established,
         federal programs seem to become immortal.</p>
      <p>It's time for a more dynamic program life cycle. Some programs should
         increase. Some should decrease. Some should be terminated. And some
         should be consolidated and turned over to the states.</p>
      <p>My budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling
         more than $20 billion. Working with Congress and the governors, I
         propose we select at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them
         over to the states in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for
         flexible management by the states.</p>
      <p>The value of this turnover approach is straightforward. It allows the
         Federal Government to reduce overhead. It allows states to manage more
         flexibly and more efficiently. It moves power and decision-making closer
         to the people. And it re-enforces a theme of this Administration:
         appreciation and encouragement of the innovative power of "states as
         laboratories."</p>
      <p>This nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in
         the hands of the people. They planned for the future. And so must
         we--here and around the world.</p>
      <p>As Americans, we know there are times when we must step forward and
         accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of
         dictators, toward the bright promise of a better day.</p>
      <p>Almost 50 years ago, we began a long struggle against aggressive
         totalitarianism. Now we face another defining hour for America and the
         world.</p>
      <p><span class="war">There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of
            freedom, than every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman and
            coastguardsman-- every man and every woman now serving in the Persian
            Gulf.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Each of them has volunteered to provide for this nation's defense. And
            now they bravely struggle to earn for America and for the world and for
            future generations, a just and lasting peace.</span></p>
      <p>Our commitment to them must be equal of their commitment to our country.
         They are truly America's finest.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The war in the gulf is not a war we wanted. We worked hard to avoid war.
            For more than five months we, along with the Arab League, the European
            Community and the United Nations, tried every diplomatic avenue. U.N.
            Secretary General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterand,
            Ozal, Mubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers
            Major and Andreotti--just to name a few--all worked for a solution. But
            time and again Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and
            peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">The world well knows how this conflict began, and when: it began on
            August 2nd, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless
            neighbor. And I am certain of how it will end. So that peace can
            prevail, we will prevail.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Tonight I'm pleased to report that we are on course. Iraq's capacity to
            sustain war is being destroyed. Our investment, our training, our
            planning --all are paying off. Time will not be Saddam's salvation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out from
            Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to insure the
            stability and security of this critical region.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability and security. We
            do not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture or its people. Rather,
            we seek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy, not to
            serve the ambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itself
            and its neighbors. We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer
            the rule, where the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate
            the weak.</span></p>
      <p>Most Americans know instinctively why we are in the Gulf. They know we
         had to stop Saddam now, not later. They know this brutal dictator will
         do anything, will use any weapon, will commit any outrage, no matter how
         many innocents must suffer.</p>
      <p>They know we must make sure that control of the world's oil resources
         does not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression. They
         know that we need to build a new, enduring peace--based not on arms
         races and confrontation, but on shared principles and the rule of law.</p>
      <p>And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace
         in the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.</p>
      <p>Democracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent, and we have
         heard some dissenting voices here at home, some reckless, most
         responsible. But the fact the all the voices have the right to speak out
         is one of the reasons we've been united in principle and purpose for 200
         years.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance
            and a steadfast commitment to a strong defense. Now, with remarkable
            technological advances like the Patriot missile, we can defend the
            ballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Looking forward, I have directed that the S.D.I. program be refocused on
            providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever
            their source. Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any
            future threat to the United States, to our forces overseas and to our
            friends and allies.</span></p>
      <p>The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has
         enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions, and
         help minimize the loss of life. We have given our men and women the very
         best. And they deserve it.</p>
      <p>We all have a special place in our hearts for the families of men and
         women serving in the Gulf. They are represented here tonight, by Mrs.
         Norman Schwarzkopf, and to all those serving with him. And to the
         families, let me say, our forces in the gulf will not stay there one day
         longer than is necessary to complete their mission.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The courage and success of the R.A.F. pilots--of the Kuwaiti, Saudi,
            French, Canadians, Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain--all are
            proof that for the first time since World War II, the international
            community is united. The leadership of the United Nations, once only a
            hoped-for ideal, is now confirming its founders' vision.</span></p>
      <p>I am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial
         burden of this struggle. Last year, our friends and allies provided the
         bulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield, and having now received
         commitments of over $40 billion for the first three months of 1991, I am
         confident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But the world has to wonder what the dictator of Iraq is thinking. If he
            thinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia,
            that he will gain an advantage--he is dead wrong. If he thinks that he
            will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental
            terrorism--he is dead wrong. And if he thinks that by abusing coalition
            P.O.W.s, he will benefit--he is dead wrong.</span></p>
      <p>We will succeed in the Gulf. And when we do, the world community will
         have sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or
         future, who contemplates outlaw aggression.</p>
      <p>The world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held
         promise of a new world order--where brutality will go unrewarded, and
         aggression will meet collective resistance.</p>
      <p>Yes, the United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort.
         Among the nations of the world, only the United States of America has
         had both the moral standing, and the means to back it up. We are the
         only nation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace.</p>
      <p>This is the burden of leadership--and the strength that has made America
         the beacon of freedom in a searching world.</p>
      <p><span class="war">This nation has never found glory in war. Our people have never wanted
            to abandon the blessings of home and work, for distant lands and deadly
            conflict. If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at
            all. And all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight
            again.</span></p>
      <p>Each of us will measure, within ourselves, the value of this great
         struggle. Any cost in lives is beyond our power to measure. But the cost
         of closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to imagine.</p>
      <p>This we do know: Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is
         right.</p>
      <p>Let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of
         freedom. Let them say, we stood where duty required us to stand.</p>
      <p>Let them know that together, we affirmed America, and the world, as a
         community of conscience.</p>
      <p>The winds of change are with us now. The forces of freedom are united.
         We move toward the next century, more confident than ever, that we have
         the will at home and abroad, to do what must be done--the hard work of
         freedom.</p>
      <p>May God bless the United States of America.
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_28,_1992" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>George H.W. Bush</h2>
      <h3>January 28, 1992</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of Congress, honored
         guests and fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises
         they hold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them
         and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age.</p>
      <p>We gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our
         history, and in the history of man on earth. For in the past 12 months,
         the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions. And even
         now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I am not
         sure we have absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened.</p>
      <p>But Communism died this year. Even as President, with the most
         fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy
         helping to manage progress and lead change that I didn't always show the
         joy that was in my heart But the biggest thing that has happened in the
         world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America
         won the Cold War. And there's another to be singled out, though it may
         seem inelegant. I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer. No
         ever thinks to thank the people who pay country's bill or an alliance's
         bill. But for a half Century now, the American people have shouldered
         the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to
         support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial
         communism had never existed. But it did. But it doesn't anymore. And
         here is a fact I wouldn't mind the world acknowledging: The American
         taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden, and deserves a hunk of the glory.</p>
      <p><span class="war">And so, now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand
            down. No longer are they on round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children
            will go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won't
            have, as my children did, air-raid drills in which they crawl under
            their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My
            grandchildren don't have to do that, and won't have the bad dreams
            children once had in decades past. There are still threats. But the long
            drawn-out dread is over.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">A year ago tonight I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American
            forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in
            the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of
            America's armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I
            declared, and that you endorsed: we liberated Kuwait.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously, and
            comprehensively, about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at
            Christmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were
            vindicated.</span></p>
      <p>Much good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come
         from this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one
         sole and pre-eminent power, the United States of America. And this they
         regard with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world
         is right. They trust us to be fair, and restrained. They trust us to be
         on the side of decency. They trust us to do what's right.</p>
      <p>I use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received
         a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in
         the gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she
         wanted me to know that some day, when her children were old enough, she
         would tell them "that their father went away to war because it was the
         right thing to do". She said it all. It was the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>And we did it together. There were honest differences here, in this
         chamber. But when the war began, you put your partisanship aside and
         supported our troops. This is still a time for pride, but this is no
         time to boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once
         again and solve them--and not let our country down.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected
         the changes of the new era. But now, this year, with Imperial Communism
         gone, that process can be accelerated. Tonight I can tell you of
         dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we
         are taking on our own, because they are the right thing to do.</p>
      <p><span class="war">After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will
            shut down production of the B-2 bomber. We will cancel the ICBM program.
            We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based missiles. We
            will stop all production of the peacekeeper missile. And we will not
            purchase any more advanced cruise missiles.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian
            Federation. I have informed President Yeltsin that if the commonwealth,
            the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead
            ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all
            Peacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman
            missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based
            missiles by about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion
            of our strategic to primarily conventional use.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">President Yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and I expect
            our talks at Camp David to be fruitful.</span> I want you to know that for half
         a century, American presidents have longed to make such decisions and
         say such words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep
         caution as a friend. For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the
         dead have seen the end of conflict. And though yesterday's challenges
         are behind us, tomorrow's are being born.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The Secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with
            the joint chiefs of staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not
            misunderstand me: The reductions I have approved will save us an
            additional $50 billion over the next five years. By 1997 we will have
            cut defense by 30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and
            you must know my resolve: this deep, and no deeper. To do less would be
            insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history.</span> We
         must not go back to the days of "the hollow army". We cannot repeat the
         mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by
         recklessness and defense was purged as if the world was permanently
         safe.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding
            a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack.</span> We
         must have this protection because too many people in too many countries
         have access to nuclear arms. There are those who say that now we can
         turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special
         place. But we are the United States of America, the leader of the West
         that has become the leader of the world.</p>
      <p>As long as I am President we will continue to lead in support of freedom
         everywhere, not out of arrogance and not out of altruism, but for the
         safety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the
         pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is
         no virtue.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now to our troubles at home. They are not all economic, but the primary
            problem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that
            thief, is down, and interest rates are down. But unemployment is too
            high, some industries are in trouble and growth is not what it should
            be. Let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart: I
            know we're in hard times, but I know something else: This will not
            stand.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">My friends in this chamber, we can bring the same courage and sense of
            common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we
            can defeat hard times together.</span> I believe you will help. One reason is
         that you're patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I
         believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get
         the job done, because it's the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea: that people
         will do great things if only you set them free. <span class="economy">Well, we're going to
            have to set the economy free, for if this age of miracles and wonders
            has taught us anything, it's that if we can change the world, we can
            change America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to
            invest money and make new products, new industries, and new jobs. We
            must clear away obstacles to new growth: high taxes, high regulation,
            red tape, and yes, wasteful government spending. None of this will
            happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a
            plan isn't whether it's called new or dazzling. The American people
            aren't impressed by gimmicks. They're smarter on this score than all of
            us in this room. The only test of a plan is, It is sound and will it
            work? We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and
            heat up the economy. And then we need a long-term plan to keep the
            combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">There are certain things that a president can do without Congress, and I
            am going to do them. I have this evening asked major cabinet departments
            and federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal
            regulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major
            departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all
            regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and
            speed up those that will help growth.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American
            workers and businessmen and women who've been forced to go without
            needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won't neglect
            my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but
            regulatory overkill must be stopped. And I have instructed our
            government regulators to stop it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I have directed Cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up
            pro-growth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra
            $10 billion into the economy in the next six months. And our new
            transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and
            maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. That
            means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges and jobs building
            railways. And I have this evening directed the secretary of the Treasury
            to change the federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions
            of Americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can
            now choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks.
            Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one.
            This initiative could return about $25 billion back into the economy
            over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing,
            college or a new car. And finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we
            will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates
            and inflation down.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now these are the things that I can do. And now, members of Congress,
            let me tell you what you can do for your country. You must, you must
            pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. Everyone
            knows investment speeds recovery. And I am proposing this evening a
            change in the alternative minimum tax, and the creation of a new 15%
            investment tax allowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate
            investment and bring people back to work. Real estate has led our
            economy out of almost all the tough times we've ever had. Once building
            starts, carpenters and plumbers work, people buy homes and take out
            mortgages.</span></p>
      <p>My plan would modify the passive-loss rule for active real-estate
         developers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase
         real estate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but
         who can't quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time home buyers to
         withdraw savings from IRAs without penalty and provide a $5000 tax
         credit for the first purchase of that home.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">And finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to
            people who own a home, to every one who has a business, a farm or a
            single investment.</span></p>
      <p>This time, at this hour, I cannot take "No" for an answer. You must cut
         the capital gains tax on the people of this country. Never has an issue
         been so demagogued by its opponents. But the demagogues are wrong. They
         are wrong, and they know it. Sixty percent of people who benefit from
         lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital
         gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country.
         And so I'm asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of
         15.4%. And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, those of you who say, "Oh no,
         someone who's comfortable may benefit from this" you kind of remind me
         of the old definition of the Puritan, who couldn't sleep at night
         worrying that somehow someone somewhere was out having a good time.</p>
      <p>The opponents of this measure and those who've authored various
         so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber
         should be reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they
         usually hit the little guy. And maybe it's time that stopped.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This then is my short-term plan. Your part, members of Congress,
            requires enactment of these common-sense proposals that will have a
            strong effect on the economy, without breaking the budget agreement and
            without raising tax rates.</span> <span class="poverty">And while my plan is being passed and kicking
            in, we've got to care for those in trouble today. I have provided for up
            to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits,
            and I ask for Congressional action right away.</span> And I thank the
         committee--well, at last. And let's be frank. Let's be frank; let me
         level with you.</p>
      <p>I know, and you know, that my plan is unveiled in a political season. I
         know, and you know, that everything I propose will be viewed by some in
         merely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my
         aim is to increase our nation's good. And I'm doing what I think is
         right; I'm proposing what I know will help. I pride myself that I'm a
         prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue, but I understand
         politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all
         progress and then decry the lack of improvement. But let me tell you,
         let me tell you, far more important than my political future--and far
         more important than yours--is the well-being of our country. And members
         of this chamber, members of this chamber, are practical people, and I
         know you won't resent some practical advice: When people put their
         party's fortunes, whatever the party, whatever the side of this aisle,
         before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country,
         but for themselves. And they will certainly deserve it.</p>
      <p>And I submit my plan tomorrow. And I am asking you to pass it by March
         20. From the day after that--if it must be--the battle is joined. And
         you know, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight.</p>
      <p>I said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it's the second part that
         is the heart of the matter. For it's not enough to get an immediate
         burst. <span class="economy">We need long-term improvement in our economic position. We all
            know that the key to our economic future is to insure that America
            continues as the economic leader of the world. We have that in our
            power. Here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world
            trade. We will work to open markets everywhere. And in our major trade
            negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies
            that damage America's farmers and workers. And we'll get more good
            American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American Free
            Trade Agreement, and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
            But changes are here, and more are coming. The work place of the future
            will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, people who are
            computer literate, highly educated.</span></p>
      <p>And we must be the world's leader in education. And we must
         revolutionize America's schools. My America 2000 strategy will help us
         reach that goal. My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers
         more flexibility and help communities create new American schools.
         Thirty states across the nation have established America 2000 programs.
         Hundreds of cities and towns have joined. Now Congress must join this
         great movement. Pass my proposals for new American schools.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">That was my second long-term proposal. And here's my third: We must make
            common-sense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the
            marketplace. We must encourage research and development. My plan is to
            make the R and D tax credit permanent, and to provide record levels of
            support, over $76 billion this year alone for people who explore the
            promise of emerging technologies.</span></p>
      <p>And fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. And it is time
         for a major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. Its
         saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society, and in our future
         together. Surely a tired woman on her way to work at six in the morning
         on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. And surely, it's
         true that everyone who changes his or her way of life because of
         crime--from those afraid to go our at night to those afraid to walk in
         the parks they pay for--surely those people have been denied a basic
         civil right. It is time to restore it. Congress, pass my comprehensive
         crime bill. It is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it
         has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. Pass it.
         Help your country.</p>
      <p>And fifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to
         pass my enterprise-zone legislation, which will get businesses into the
         inner city. <span class="poverty">We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from
            owning a home, getting a job, becoming part of things. My plan would
            encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for
            mortgage-revenue bonds and low-income housing. And I ask tonight for
            record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want
            move into excellence: Head Start.</span></p>
      <p>Step six: We must reform our health care system for this too, bears on
         whether or not we can compete in the world. American health costs have
         been exploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on
         health, and that is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by the end of the
         decade. We simply cannot afford this. The cost of health care shows up
         not only in your family budget, but in the price of everything we buy
         and everything we sell. When health coverage for a fellow on the
         assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the product
         he makes. And you pay the bill. Now we must make a choice.</p>
      <p>Now some pretend we can have it both ways: they call it play or pay. But
         that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer
         jobs, and eventually, a system under complete government control.
         Really, there are only two options. And we can move toward a
         nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in
         picking a doctor and force the government to ration services
         arbitrarily. And what we'll get is patients in long lines, indifferent
         service and a huge new tax burden. Or we can reform our own private
         health-care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best
         quality health care in the world. Well, let's build on our strengths.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving
            and increasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance
            affordable for all low-income people not now covered. We do it by
            providing a health-insurance tax credit of up to $3750 for each
            low-income family. The middle class gets help, too. And by reforming the
            health insurance market, my plan assures that Americans will have access
            to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious
            health problem We must bring costs under control, preserve quality,
            preserve choice and reduce people's nagging daily worry about health
            insurance. My plan, the details of which I will announce shortly, does
            just that.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And seventh, we must get the federal deficit under control. We now have
            in law, enforcable spending caps, and a requirement that we pay for the
            programs we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that
            discipline now. But I cannot let them do it. And I won't. My plan would
            freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which means "No more
            next year than this year". I will not tamper with Social Security but I
            would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would
            also freeze federal domestic government employment. And with the help of
            Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve
            federal funding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is
            indispensible. We can get rid of each and every one of them.</span></p>
      <p>You know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the American people
         have never forgotten: the government is too big and spends too much. And
         I call on Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the
         annual ritual of filling the budget with pork-barrel appropriations.
         Every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples,
         a Lawrence Welk Museum, a research grant for Belgian Endive. We all know
         how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help
         you say no. I know how to say it. And you know what I need to make it
         stick. Give me the same thing 43 governors have--the line-item veto--and
         let me help you control spending.</p>
      <p>We must put an end to unfinanced government mandates. These are the
         requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties and states without
         supplying the money. And if Congress passes a mandate, it should be
         forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After
         all, a mandate just increases someone else's tax burden, and that means
         higher taxes at the state and local level.</p>
      <p>Step Eight: Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are
         still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform,
         tort reform, and my national energy strategy.</p>
      <p>And finally, we must strengthen the family, because it is the family
         that has the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS
         baby in her arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in
         this country, "Family Matters".</p>
      <p>And I am announcing tonight a new commission on America's urban
         families. I've asked Missouri's governor, John Ashcroft, to be chairman,
         former Dallas Mayor Annetter Strauss to be co-chair. You know, I had
         Mayors, the leading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day
         at the White House, and they told me something striking. They said that
         every one of them, Republican and Democrat, agreed on one thing: That
         the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the
         family. And they asked for this commission, and they were right to ask,
         because it's time to determine what we can do to keep families together,
         strong and sound.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">There's one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a
            child. I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per
            child for every family. For a family with four kids, that's an increase
            of $2000. This is a good start in the right direction, and it's what we
            can afford. It's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay
            on student loans. And I'm asking you to do just that. And I'm asking you
            to allow people to use money from their IRAs to pay medical and
            educational expenses, all without penalties. And I'm asking for more.
            Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our
            country, and chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Americans are the most generous people on Earth. But we have to go back
            to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became
            the welfare program, want that it must not become a narcotic and a
            subtle destroyer of the spirit. Welfare was never meant to be a life
            style. It was never meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be
            passed on from generation to generation like a legacy. It's time to
            replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare
            system.</span></p>
      <p>States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new
         assumptions: that when able-bodied people receive government assistance
         they have responsibilities to the taxpayer. A responsibility to seek
         work, education, or job training. A responsibility to get their lives in
         order. A responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from
         having children out of wedlock. And a responsibility to obey the law. We
         are going to help this movement. Often, state reform requires waiving
         certain federal regulations. I will act to make that process easier and
         quicker for every state that asks our help. And I want to add, as we
         make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our
         intention is not scapegoating and finger-pointing. If you read the
         papers or watch TV you know there's been a rise these days in a certain
         kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of
         division. Really, this is not us. This is not who we are. And this is
         not acceptable.</p>
      <p>And so you have my plan for America. And I am asking for big things, but
         I believe in my heart you will do what's right.</p>
      <p>And you know, it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain
         skepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes
         thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way
         through Congress. But you will deliberate, and you will discuss, and
         that is fine. But my friends the people cannot wait. They need help now.
         And there's a mood among us. People are worried. There has been talk of
         decline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. And I
         thought, "Really? Go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the
         American farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and
         women of Desert Storm." Moods come and go, but greatness endures. Our
         does.</p>
      <p>And maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailyness of
         our lives, we forget. We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth,
         the kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have
         always risen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this nation out
         of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us
         better step aside. Because I look at hard times and I make this vow:
         This will not stand. And so we move on, together, a rising nation, the
         once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the
         world.

      <h3>January 25, 1994</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the 103rd Congress, my fellow
         Americans:</p>
      <p>I am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight, but I hope we
         can talk about the State of the Union.</p>
      <p>I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided
         over this chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call
         himself "A Man of the House" and he surely was that. But even more, he
         was a man of the people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the
         great American middle class. Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where
         he came from, or who sent him here. Tonight he's smiling down on us for
         the first time from the Lord's gallery. But in his honor, may we too
         also remember who we are, where we come from, and who sent us here.</p>
      <p>If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that
         if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education,
         and a fair shot at the American dream, they will do extraordinary
         things.</p>
      <p>We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all
         nations are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such
         change, to use it to expand opportunity at home, and our leadership
         abroad. But for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was
         abandoned, and our country drifted.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For 30 years family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years
            the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12
            years of trickle down economics we built a false prosperity on a hollow
            base as our national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992 we experienced
            the slowest growth in a half century. For too many families, even when
            both parents were working, the American dream has been slipping away.</span></p>
      <p>In 1992 the American people demanded that we change. I year ago I asked
         all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our
         country.</p>
      <p>Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform.
         And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people,
         who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a
         president and a Congress in 30 years.</p>
      <p>Accomplishments</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion
            dollars, cut spending and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest
            Americans. This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income
            workers to reward work over welfare. It produced NAFTA. It produced the
            Brady bill, now the Brady law.</span></p>
      <p>And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, Sarah. This
         <span class="economy">Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small
            businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs.</span> It
         produced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood
         immunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable
         college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for
         those who want to give something back to their country and their
         communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech
         investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy.
         This Congress produced a new law--the motor voter bill--to help millions
         of people register to vote. It produced family and medical leave--all
         passed, all signed into law, with not one single veto.</p>
      <p>These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this
         office, and in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this
         Congress. But I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people
         who sent us here, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fire.
         But what we do here is really beginning to change lives. Let me just
         give you one example.</p>
      <p>Family And Medical Leave</p>
      <p>I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just
         one father I met early one Sunday morning in the White House. It was
         unusual to see a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had
         his wife and his three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. And
         I came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I
         was walking off, and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, "Mr.
         President, let me tell you something. My little girl here is desperately
         ill. She's probably not going to make it. But because of the family
         leave law, I was able to take time off to spend with her, the most
         important I ever spent in my life, without losing my job and hurting the
         rest of my family. It means more to me than I will ever be able to say.
         Don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a
         difference. It does."</p>
      <p>Though we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many
         Americans still haven't felt the impact of what we've done. <span class="economy">The recovery
            still hasn't touched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are
            still stagnant.</span> There's still too much violence and not enough hope in
         too many places.</p>
      <p>Abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very
         difficult times and look to us for leadership.</p>
      <p>And so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to
         create more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to
         reward welfare--work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad and to
         begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs to
         renew our own American community.</p>
      <p>Deficit Reduction</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last year, we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget
            deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. We cut $255 billion in
            spending, including entitlements, in over 340 separate budget items. We
            froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.</span></p>
      <p>Led by the vice president, we've launched a campaign to reinvent
         government. We've cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of
         federal limousines. After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked
         bureaucracy but whose actions expanded it, we will actually reduce it by
         252,000 people over the next five years. By the time we have finished,
         the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax
            cuts in the 1980s, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to
            reduce the deficit. So on April the 15th, the American people will
            discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes. Only the top
            one--the top 1.2 percent of Americans, as I said all along, will face
            higher income tax rates--let me repeat, only the wealthiest 1.2 percent
            of Americans will face higher income tax rates and no one else will, and
            that is the truth. Of course, there were, as there always are in
            politics, naysayers who said this plan wouldn't work, but they were
            wrong. When I became president, the experts predicted that next year's
            deficit would be $300 billion, but because we acted, those same people
            now say the deficit's going to be under $180 billion, 40 percent lower
            than was previously predicted.</span></p>
      <p>The Economy</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation
            rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years, and because those
            interest rates are down, business investment and equipment is growing at
            seven times the rate of the previous four years. Auto sales are way up,
            home sales at a record high. Millions of Americans have refinanced their
            homes and our economy has produced 1.6 million private-sector jobs in
            1993, more than were created in the previous four years combined.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early
            results--proud. But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge
            that there is more to do. Next month I will send you one of the toughest
            budgets ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than
            300 programs, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reforms the way in
            which governments buy goods and services.</span></p>
      <p>This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard
         spending ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can
         bring the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing
         seniors or the middle class, and without putting our national security
         at risk. If you will stick with this plan, we will post three
         consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry
         Truman lived in the White House. And once again, the buck stops here.</p>
      <p>Trade</p>
      <p>Our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around
         the world. Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our
         competitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade
         barriers. In one year, with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia
         and the national export strategy, we did more to open world markets to
         American products than at any time in the last two generations. That
         means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people, low
         deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers and high
         investments. These are the building blocks of our recovery. But if we
         want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global
         economy, you all know we must do more.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">As we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the
            technologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong
            militarily and create jobs for our people here at home.</span></p>
      <p>As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental
         technologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will
         fight for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act
         and a reformed Superfund program.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">And the vice president is right; we must also work with the private
            sector to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every
            hospital in America into a national information superhighway by the year
            2000. Think of it. Instant access to information will increase
            productivity. It will help to educate our children. It will provide
            better medical care. It will create jobs. And I call on the Congress to
            pass legislation to establish that information superhighway this year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">As we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We
            must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil
            rights laws, because America will never be complete in its renewal until
            everyone shares in its bounty. But we all know, too, we can do all these
            things-- put our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the
            jobs of the future, guarantee equal opportunity.</span></p>
      <p>But if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot
         work unless we also give our people the education, training and skills
         they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow. We must set tough,
         world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and
         give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them.</p>
      <p>Education</p>
      <p>Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to
         experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private
         corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they
         wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are
         our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the
         global economy?</p>
      <p>Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms and I hope
         Congress will pass it without delay. Our school to work initiative will
         for the first time link school to the world of work, providing at least
         one year of apprenticeship beyond high school. After all, most of the
         people we're counting on to build our economic future won't graduate
         from college. It's time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them.
         We must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new
         reemployment system. The old unemployment system just sort of kept you
         going while you waited for your old job to come back. We've got to have
         a new system to move people into new and better jobs because most of
         those old jobs just don't come back. And we know that the only way to
         have real job security in the future, to get a good job with a growing
         income, is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones. So
         we've got to streamline today's patchwork of training programs and make
         them a source of new skill for our people who lose their jobs.
         Reemployment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our
         economic renewal. I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress.</p>
      <p>Welfare</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">And just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also
            revolutionize our welfare system. It doesn't work; it defies our values
            as a nation. If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes
            welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing
            their health care.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child
            support absent parents out to be paying to millions of parents who are
            taking care of their children--. If we value strong families, we can't
            perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. Can
            you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the
            government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a
            grandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong and we ought to
            change it.</span></p>
      <p>I worked on this problem for years before I became president, with other
         governors and with members of Congress in both parties and with the
         previous administration of another party. I worked on it with people who
         were on welfare, lots of them. And I want to say something to everybody
         here who cares about this issue. <span class="poverty">The people who most want to change this
            system are the people who are dependent on it. They want to get off
            welfare; they want to go back to work; they want to do right by their
            kids.</span></p>
      <p>I once had a hearing when I was a governor and I brought in people on
         welfare from all over America who had found their way to work and a
         woman from my state who testified was asked this question. What's the
         best thing about being off welfare and in a job. And without blinking an
         eye, she looked at 40 governors and she said, when my boy goes to school
         and they say "What does your mother do for a living?" he can give an
         answer. These people want a better system and we ought to give it to
         them.</p>
      <p>Last year, we began this. We gave the states more power to innovate
         because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington
         and many states are already using it. Then this Congress took a dramatic
         step.<span class="economy"> Instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we
            helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing
            the earned income tax credit. It will lift 15 million working families
            out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, making it possible for
            people to be successful workers and successful parents. Now that's real
            welfare reform.</span></p>
      <p>But there is more to be done. This spring I will send you a
         comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act
         of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. We
         will say to teenagers if you have a child out of wedlock, we'll no
         longer give you a check to set up a separate household, we want families
         to stay together; say to absent parents who aren't paying their child
         support if you're not providing for your children we'll garnish your
         wages, suspend your license, track you across state lines, and if
         necessary make some of you work off what you owe.</p>
      <p>People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away
         from them.</p>
      <p>But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a
         simple compact. We will provide the support, the job training, the child
         care you need for up to two years, but after that anyone who can work,
         must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service if
         necessary. That's the only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to
         be, a second chance, not a way of life.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same
            time we tackle health care. But let me point out, I think it is
            inevitable and imperative. It is estimated that one million people are
            on welfare today because it's the only way they can get health care
            coverage for their children. Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs
            without health benefits, and many entry level jobs don't have health
            benefits, find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes
            that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other
            choice, to stay on welfare. No wonder people leave work and go back to
            welfare, to get health care coverage. We've got to solve the health care
            problem to have real welfare reform.</span></p>
      <p>Health Care Reform</p>
      <p>So this year we will make history by reforming the health care system.
         And I would say to you, all of you my fellow public servants, this is
         another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians.</p>
      <p>That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the
         truth.</p>
      <p>You know, the first lady has received now almost a million letters from
         people all across America and from all walks of life. I'd like to share
         just one of them with you. Richard Anderson of Reno, Nevada, lost his
         job and, with it, his health insurance. Two weeks later, his wife, Judy,
         suffered a cerebral aneurysm. He rushed her to the hospital, where she
         stayed in intensive care for 21 days. The Anderson's bills were over
         $120,000. Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at $8 an
         hour, the bills were too much for them and they were literally forced
         into bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>"Mrs. Clinton," he wrote to Hillary, "no one in the United States of
         America should have to lose everything they've worked for all their
         lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill." It was to
         help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the first lady and
         so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care
         reform issue. We owe them our thanks and our action.</p>
      <p>I know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis. Tell
         it to Richard and Judy Anderson. Tell it to the 58 million Americans who
         have no coverage at all for some time each year. Tell it to the 81
         million Americans with those preexisting conditions; those folks are
         paying more or they can't get insurance at all or they can't ever change
         their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those
         preexisting conditions. Tell it to the small businesses burdened by
         skyrocketing costs of insurance. Most small businesses cover their
         employers, and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big
         businesses or government. Or tell it to the 76 percent of insured
         Americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits, and
         that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just
         when they need it the most.</p>
      <p>So, if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those
         people, because I can't.</p>
      <p>There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this
         problem on people's lives, but all you have to do is go out and listen
         to them. Just go talk to them anywhere, in any congressional district in
         this country. They're Republicans and Democrats and independents. It
         doesn't have a lick to do with party. They think we don't get it, and
         it's time we show that we do get it.</p>
      <p>From the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to
         strengthen what is good about our health care system--the world's best
         health care professionals, cutting edge research, and wonderful research
         institutions, Medicare for older Americans. None of this--none of it
         should be put at risk. But we're paying more and more money for less and
         less care. Every year, fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose
         their doctors. Every year, doctors and nurses spend more time on
         paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute
         bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become.</p>
      <p>This system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and
         everybody knows it. In today's health care system, insurance companies
         call the shots. They pick whom they cover and how they cover them. They
         can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most. They are
         in charge.</p>
      <p>What does it mean? It means every night millions of well-insured
         Americans go to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away
         from having no coverage or financial ruin. It means every morning
         millions of Americans go to work without any health insurance at
         all--something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do.
         It means that every year more and more hard working people are told to
         pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan. And
         countless others turndown better jobs because they know, if they take
         the better job, they'll lose their health insurance.</p>
      <p>If we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country
         will have people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bill.</p>
      <p>Now, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices. It
         builds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer
         based coverage, to guarantee private insurance for every American. And I
         might say, employer based private insurance for every American was
         proposed 20 years ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States
         Congress. It was a good idea then, and it's a better idea today.</p>
      <p>Why do we want guaranteed private insurance? Because right now, nine out
         of ten people who have insurance get it through their employers--and
         that should continue. And if your employer is providing good benefits at
         reasonable prices, that should continue too. And that ought to make the
         Congress and the president feel better. Our goal is health insurance
         everybody can depend on--comprehensive benefits that cover preventive
         care and prescription drugs, health premiums that don't just explode
         when you get sick or you get older, the power--no matter how small your
         business is --to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive
         rates that governments and big business get today, one simple form for
         people who are sick, and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and
         the right to choose your own doctor.</p>
      <p>Our approach protects older Americans. Every plan before the Congress
         proposes to slow the growth of Medicare. The difference is this. We
         believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior
         citizens. Medicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription
         drugs, and we should take the first steps in covering long-term care.</p>
      <p>To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the
         solution to today's squeeze on middle class working people's health care
         is not to put the squeeze on middle class retired people's health care.
         We can do better than that. When it's all said and done, it's pretty
         simple to me. Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean. You pay a
         fair price for security, and when you get sick, health care is always
         there--no matter what.</p>
      <p>Along with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too,
         there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use
         this system. People have to take their kids to get immunized. We should
         all take advantage of preventive care. We must all work together to stop
         the violence that explodes our emergency rooms. We have to practice
         better health habits, and we can't abuse the system. And those who don't
         have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but they will have
         to pay something for it, too. The minority of businesses that provide no
         insurance at all, and in so doing, shift the cost of the care of their
         employees to others, should contribute something. People who smoke
         should pay more for a pack of cigarettes. Everybody can contribute
         something if we want to solve the health care crisis. There can't be
         anymore something for nothing. It will not be easy, but it can be done.
         Now in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats
         and Republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to
         bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security. But if you look
         at history, we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform
         health care. President Roosevelt tried, President Truman tried,
         President Nixon tried, President Carter tried. Every time the special
         interests were powerful enough to defeat them, but not this time.</p>
      <p>Campaign Finance Reform</p>
      <p>I know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will
         raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how
         lobbyists yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never
         get any easier until we limit the influence of well financed interests
         who profit from this current system. So I also must now call on you to
         finish the job both houses began last year, by passing tough and
         meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this
         year.</p>
      <p>You know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The
         American people provide those of us in government service with terrific
         health care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's
         always there. I think we need to give every hard working, taxpaying
         American the same health care security they have already given to us.</p>
      <p>I want to make this very clear: I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to
         the best ideas of concerned members of both parties. I have no special
         brief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: if
         you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private
         health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take
         this pen, veto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start
         all over again.</p>
      <p>But I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're ready to act
         now. I believe that you're ready to act now. And if you're ready to
         guarantee every American the same health care that you have, health care
         that can never be taken away--now, not next year or the year after, now
         is the time to stand with the people who sent us here. Now.</p>
      <p>Foreign Policy</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">As we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot
            turn away from our obligations to renew our leadership abroad. This is a
            promising moment. Because of the agreements we have reached this year,
            last year, Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be
            pointed at the United States. Nor will we point ours at them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Instead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to
            build the international space station.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And of course there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms
            proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist
            tensions in many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the
            world over, and fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with
            terror. As the world's greatest power, we must therefore maintain our
            defenses and our responsibilities. This year we secured indictments
            against terrorists and sanctions against those harbor them. We worked to
            promote environmentally-sustainable economic growth. We achieved
            agreements with Ukraine, with Belarus, with Kazakhstan, to eliminate
            completely their nuclear arsenals. We are working to achieve a Korean
            Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.</span> <span class="diplomacy">We will seek early ratification of
            the treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide. And earlier today we
            joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban
            to stop all nuclear testing.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">But nothing--nothing--is more important to our security than our
            nation's armed forces. We honor their contributions, including those who
            are carrying out the longest humanitarian airlift in history in
            Bosnia---- those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year
            and their brave comrades who gave their lives there. Our forces are the
            finest military our nation has ever had, and I have pledged that as long
            as I am president they will remain the best-equipped, the best-trained
            and the best-prepared fighting force on the face of the earth.</span></p>
      <p>Defense</p>
      <p><span class="war">Last year, I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-Cold War
            security at a lower cost. This year, many people urged me to cut our
            defense spending further to pay for other government programs. I said
            no. The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense
            cuts. It protects the readiness and quality of our forces. Ultimately,
            the best strategy is to do that. We must not cut defense further. I hope
            the Congress without regard to party will support that position.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a
            durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere.
            Democracies don't attack each other. They make better trading partners
            and partners in diplomacy. That is why we have supported, you and I, the
            democratic reformers in Russia and in the other states of the former
            Soviet bloc. I applaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided
            last year for our initiatives to help Russia, Ukraine and the other
            states through their epic transformations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task
            and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue
            to urge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic
            reforms, and we will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional
            problems while insisting that, if Russian troops operate in neighboring
            states, they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in
            strict accord with international standards.</span></p>
      <p>But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures, and
         they must chart their own futures, how much more secure and more
         prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reform
         succeed all across the former communist bloc. Our policy has been to
         support that move and that has been the policy of the Congress. We
         should continue it.</p>
      <p>Europe</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">That is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our
            European partners to help to integrate all the former communist
            countries into a Europe that has the possibility of becoming unified for
            the first time in its entire history, it's entire history, based on the
            simple commitments of all nations in Europe to democracy, to free
            markets, and to respect for existing borders.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">With our allies, we have created a partnership for peace that invites
            states from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work
            with NATO in military cooperation. When I met with Central Europe's
            leaders, including Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, men who put their lives
            on the line for freedom, I told them that the security of their region
            is important to our country's security.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This year, we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human
            rights and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask
            Congress to ratify the new GATT accord, we will continue standing by
            South Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and
            difficult transition to democracy. We will convene a summit of the
            Western hemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South
            America. And we will continue to press for the restoration of true
            democracy in Haiti.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must
            continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human
            rights record.</span></p>
      <p>Middle East</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last
            year the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat at the White House
            when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a
            long, hard road ahead. And on that road I am determined that I and our
            administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting
            peace for all the peoples of the region.</span></p>
      <p>Now, there are some in our country who argue that with the Cold War,
         America should turn its back on the rest of the world. Many around the
         world were afraid we would do just that. But I took this office on a
         pledge that had no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remaining
         engaged in the rest of the world. And this year, because of our work
         together, enacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared,
         supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership,
         America's engagement, and as a result, the American people are more
         secure than they were before.</p>
      <p>Crime</p>
      <p>But while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all
         now that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home.
         Everyday the national peace is shattered by crime.</p>
      <p>In Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to
         agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas. An ordinary train ride
         on Long Island ends in a hail of nine millimeter rounds. <span class="civil-rights">A tourist in
            Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black.</span>
         Right here in our nation's capital, a brave young man named Jason White,
         a policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned
         down.</p>
      <p>Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society,
         limiting personal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us.</p>
      <p>The crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about
         it, a chance to be tough and smart. What does that mean? Let me begin by
         saying I care a lot about this issue. Many years ago, when I started out
         in public life, I was the attorney general of my state. I served as a
         governor for a dozen years. I know what it's like to sign laws
         increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death
         penalty. I understand this issue and it is not a simple thing.</p>
      <p>First, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a
         small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when
         they are on parole. Now those who commit crimes should be punished, and
         those who commit repeated violent crimes should be told when you commit
         a third violent crime, you will be put away and put away for good, three
         strikes and you are out.</p>
      <p>Second, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime,
         beginning with more police officers and more community policing. We know
         right now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the
         respect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know
         that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals.
         Look at the experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17
         percent in one year when that approach was taken. Here tonight is one of
         those community policemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose
         beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New
         York. Every day he restores some sanity and safety, and a sense of
         values and connection to the people whose lives he protects. I'd like to
         ask him to stand up and be recognized tonight.</p>
      <p>You will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law
         abiding working people of this country, and don't forget, in the
         toughest neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime
         neighborhoods in this country the vast majority of people get up every
         day and obey the law, pay their taxes, do their best to raise their
         kids. They deserve people like Kevin Jett, and you're going to be given
         the chance to give the American people another 100,000 of them, well
         trained, and I urge you to do it.</p>
      <p>You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police
         corps to encourage young people to get an education, and pay it off by
         serving as police officers, which encourages retiring military personnel
         to move into police forces--and enormous resources for our country, one
         which has a safe schools provisions which will give our young people the
         chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead
         of dodging bullets. These are important things.</p>
      <p>The third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady Bill--the Brady
         Law to take further steps----to take further steps to keep guns out of
         the hands of criminals.</p>
      <p>Now, I want to say something about this issue. Hunters must always be
         free to hunt, law abiding adults should always be free to own guns and
         protect their homes. I respect that part of our culture. I grew up in
         it. But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to
         join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence. I say to you, I know
         you didn't create this problem, but we need your help to solve it. There
         is no sporting purpose on earth that should stop the United States
         Congress from banishing assault weapons that outgun police and cut down
         children.</p>
      <p>Fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous
         percentage of crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is
         on the rise again among our young people. The Crime Bill contains--all
         the crime bills contain--more money for drug treatment, for criminal
         addicts, and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives
         to get off drugs and to stay off drugs. Our administration's budget,
         with all its cuts, contains a large increase in funding for drug
         treatment and drug education. You must pass them both. We need then
         desperately.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an un-American problem.
         It has no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you find
         ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a
         strong, smart, tough crime bill.</p>
      <p>But further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher
         penalties for those who choose violence, let us also remember how we
         came to this sad point. In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest
         streets, <span class="poverty">in our poorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and
            simultaneous breakdown of community, family, and work, the heart and
            soul of civilized society.</span> This has created a vast vacuum which has been
         filled by violence and drugs and gangs. So I ask you to remember that
         even as we say no to crime, we must give people, especially our young
         people something to say yes to. <span class="economy">Many of our initiatives, from job
            training to welfare reform to health care to national service will help
            to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen families, to provide
            work, but more needs to be done. That's what our community empowerment
            agenda is all about--challenging businesses to provide more investment
            through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the same
            communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the
            power of capital through community development banks to create jobs,
            opportunity, and hope where they're needed most.</span></p>
      <p>But I think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have
         to put our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find
         some new ideas to do even more.</p>
      <p>The Role Of Government</p>
      <p>And let's be honest, we all know something else, too. Our problems go
         way beyond the reach of government. They're rooted in the loss of values
         and the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and our
         communities. My fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs,
         promote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care,
         pass the toughest crime bill in history and still leave too many of our
         people behind.</p>
      <p>The American people have got to want to change from within if we're
         going to bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our
         country when, within a decade, more than half of the children will be
         born into families where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew
         this country when 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9
         year olds for kicks. We can't renew our country when children are having
         children and the fathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to
         anything. <span class="economy">We can't renew the country when our businesses eagerly look
            for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people
            right here at home who'd give anything to have their jobs and would
            gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it.</span></p>
      <p>We can't renew our country unless more of us--I mean all of us--are
         willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, <span class="civil-rights">people like
            all the black ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests
            and the nuns </span>I met at Our Lady of Help in East Los Angeles or my good
         friend Tony Campolo in Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with
         people like that, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making
         streets safer. All of us can do that.</p>
      <p>We can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise
         children; parents do. Parents who know their children's teachers and
         turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids
         right from wrong--those kind of parents can make all the difference. I
         know. I had one. And I'm telling you we have got to stop pointing our
         fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to
         them. Our country needs it. We need it. And they deserve it.</p>
      <p>And so I say to you tonight let's give our children a future. Let us
         take away their guns and give them books. Let us overcome their despair
         and replace it with hope. Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the
         law, respect our neighbors, and cherish our values. Let us weave these
         sturdy threads into a new American community that once more stand strong
         against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to
         walk into a better tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the
         challenges of this time, but they misread our history, our heritage,
         even today's headlines. All those things tell us we can and we will
         overcome any challenge.</p>
      <p>When the earth shook and fires raged in California; when I saw the
         Mississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500 year flood;
         when the century's bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport
         News it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams.
         But the American people, they just came together. They rose to the
         occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to
         stay total strangers, showing the better angels of our nature.</p>
      <p>Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving
         our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting.</p>
      <p>Let us instead by true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together,
         bringing hope and moving forward.</p>
      <p>Tonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as
         old as the republic itself, what is the state of our union?</p>
      <p>It is growing stronger but it must be stronger still. With your help and
         God's help it will be.</p>
      <p>Thank you and God Bless America.

      <h3>January 24, 1995</h3>
      <p>Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 104th Congress, my fellow
         Americans:</p>
      <p>Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy. And once again, our
         democracy has spoken.</p>
      <p>So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress,
         and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
      <p>If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American
         people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994.</p>
      <p>And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.</p>
      <p>I must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard
         America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike,
         must say: We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have
         given us. For we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be
         faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.</p>
      <p>Over 200 years ago, our founders changed the entire course of human
         history by joining together to create a new country based on a single,
         powerful idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, <span class="civil-rights">that all men are
            created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.</span>
         Among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
      <p>It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea--the
         American idea--and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different
         times. <span class="civil-rights">To Lincoln and to his Congress, to preserve the Union and to end
            slavery.</span> To Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to restrain the
         abuses and excesses of the Industrial Revolution and to assert our
         leadership in the world. <span class="economy">To Franklin Roosevelt, to fight the failure and
            pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle
            against fascism.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And to all our Presidents since, to fight the cold war. Especially, I
            recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with
            Congresses where the majority was of a different party. To Harry Truman,
            who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the
            architecture of the cold war. And to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well
            tonight, and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle
            against Communism was won.</span></p>
      <p>In another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first
         President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, <span class="economy">an era marked by the
            global economy,</span> the information revolution, unparalleled change in
         opportunity and in security for the American people.</p>
      <p>I came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission: To restore
         the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into
         the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in
         the entire world.</p>
      <p>I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In
         this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes. And I have
         learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor.</p>
      <p>But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it
         was two years ago.</p>
      <p>Accomplishments</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Record numbers, record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new
            global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and
            freedom throughout the world. We have almost six million new jobs since
            I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment
            and inflation in 25 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the
            deficit down, to expand trade,</span> to put more police on our streets, to
         give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to
         rebuild their own communities. But the rising tide is not lifting all
         the boats.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our
            people are still working harder and harder for less and less. While our
            businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and
            competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job
            next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are
            threatened, things far more precious to us: our children, our families,
            our values.</span></p>
      <p>Our civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working
         together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of
         community which have been the great strength of our country from its
         very beginning are badly frayed.</p>
      <p>What are we to do about it?</p>
      <p>More than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era, President
         Roosevelt told our nation new conditions impose new requirements on
         Government and those who conduct Government. And from that simple
         proposition he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our nation
         to prosperity and defined the relationship between our people and their
         Government for half a century.</p>
      <p>That approach worked in its time but today we face a very different time
         and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age
         built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and
         learning and flexibility.</p>
      <p>Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many
         as simply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our
         citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used
         to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.</p>
      <p>So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of
         this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings
         not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as
         Americans.</p>
      <p>New Covenant</p>
      <p>That's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New
         Covenant but it's grounded in a very, very old idea that all Americans
         have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as
         their God-given talents and determination can take them. And to give
         something back to their communities and their country in return.</p>
      <p>Opportunity and responsibility--they go hand in hand; we can't have one
         without the other, and our national community can't hold together
         without both.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our
            people to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change the
            way our Government works to fit a different time and, above all, how we
            can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our
            common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our
            Government and ourselves.</span></p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the
         occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we
         embark on this course, let us put our country first, remembering that
         regardless of party label we are all Americans. And let the final test
         of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?</p>
      <p>Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better
         citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing
         that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private
         sector--and I was proud to sign it yesterday.</p>
      <p>But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things
         work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and
         corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people
         look at their capital and they see a city where the well-connected and
         the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary
         citizens are often left out.</p>
      <p>As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing
         business as usual--the gifts, the trips--all the things that people are
         concerned about haven't stopped.</p>
      <p>Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I
         know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use
         something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time:
         There doesn't have to be a law for everything.</p>
      <p>So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks, just
         stop.</p>
      <p>We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to
         the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you
         will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign
         that, too. We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they
         work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role
         of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting
         the influence of PAC's.</p>
      <p>And as I have said for three years, we should work to open the air waves
         so that they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of
         destruction by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.</p>
      <p>When the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was
         reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of
         this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at
         home something to cheer about.</p>
      <p>More important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the
         Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly and smarter. Leaner
         not meaner.</p>
      <p>I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine's alive and well.</p>
      <p>The Role Of Government</p>
      <p>The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old
         bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old
         way of governing around here protected organized interests; we should
         look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by
         interests, constituency or class; the New Covenant way should unite us
         behind a common vision of what's best for our country.</p>
      <p>The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible
         bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and
         decision making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and
         competition and individual responsibility into national policy.</p>
      <p>The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure.
         The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success.</p>
      <p>The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way
         must take hold in the communities all across America, and we should help
         them to do that.</p>
      <p>Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower
         people to make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security
         here at home and abroad.</p>
      <p>We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We
         should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for
         ourselves and for each other.</p>
      <p>I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters,
         we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there
         is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other
         illusion that the Government is the source of every problem that we
         have.</p>
      <p>Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people
         can meet today's and tomorrow's needs.</p>
      <p>And we ought to do it together.</p>
      <p>You know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they
         would cut Government and how bad it was. But not much happened.</p>
      <p>We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in
         spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions
         from the Federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone.</p>
      <p>Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a
         quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it
         the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was president, by the time I
         come here again next year.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have
            already saved taxpayers $ 63 billion. The age of the $ 500 hammer and
            the ashtray you can break on David Letterman is gone.</span> Deadwood programs
         like mohair subsidies are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture
         Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. <span class="economy">We've slashed the
            small-business loan form from an inch thick to a single page.</span> We've
         thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.</p>
      <p>And the Government is working better in important ways. FEMA, the
         Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to
         helping people in disaster.</p>
      <p>You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or
         the people in California who've dealt with floods and earthquakes and
         fires and they'll tell you that.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Government workers, working hand-in-hand with private business, rebuilt
            Southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under
            budget.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600
            schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.</span></p>
      <p>Now, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to
         just mention one because it'll be discussed here in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">University administrators all over the country have told me that they
            are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our
            direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more
            affordable with better repayment terms for students,</span> costs the
         Government less and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the
         Government and for the universities.</p>
      <p>We shouldn't cap that program, we should give every college in America
         the opportunity to be a part of it.</p>
      <p>Previous Government programs gather dust; the reinventing Government
         report is getting results. And we're not through--there's going to be a
         second round of reinventing Government.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We propose to cut $ 130 billion in spending by shrinking departments,
            extending our freeze on domestic spending,</span> cutting 60 public housing
         programs down to 3, getting rid of over a hundred programs we do not
         need like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve
         Program.</p>
      <p>And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making
         them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived
         their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to
         help solve tomorrow's problems.</p>
      <p>And we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve.
         We need to help move programs down to the point where states and
         communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better
         job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of
         the way and let them do what they can do better.</p>
      <p>Community Empowerment</p>
      <p>Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to
         communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be
         for. It's time for Congress to stop passing onto the states the cost of
         decisions we make here in Washington.</p>
      <p>I know there are still serious differences over the details of the
         unfunded mandates legislation but I want to work with you to make sure
         we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interest and
         give justified relief where we need to give it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending
            projects. Last year was no different. There was a million dollars to
            study stress in plants and $ 12 million for a tick removal program that
            didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks; those of us who've had them
            know.</span></p>
      <p>But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me the line-item veto, I'll
         remove some of that unnecessary spending.</p>
      <p>But, I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree,
         that Government still has important responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Our young people--we should think of this when we cut--our young people
         hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And
         our senior citizens have made us what we are.</p>
      <p>Budget</p>
      <p>Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social
         Security and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You
         should, and I hope you will.</p>
      <p>And when we give more flexibility to the states, let us remember that
         there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in
         every state, north and south, east and west.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our
            schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and
            infants--all these things are in the national interest.</span></p>
      <p>I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations,
         but when we deregulate let's remember what national action in the
         national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys
         for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and
         highways and safer workplaces, cleaner air and cleaner water. Do we need
         common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can
         have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have
         fairness and still clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Should we cut the deficit more? Well of course we should. Of course we
            should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our
            economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be
            punished, but instead should be helped.</span></p>
      <p>I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced-budget
         amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our Administration
         has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a
         very, very long time.</p>
      <p>If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you
         have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know
         what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, how it's
         going to affect them.</p>
      <p>And we should be doing things in the open around here. For example,
         everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social
         Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.</p>
      <p>Welfare</p>
      <p>Nothing is done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility
         than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to
         face here in Washington in our New Covenant. <span class="poverty">It rewards welfare over
            work, it undermines family values, it lets millions of parents get away
            without paying their child support, it keeps a minority--but a
            significant minority--of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very
            long time.</span></p>
      <p>I worked on this problem for a long time--nearly 15 years now. As a
         Governor I had the honor of working with the Reagan Administration to
         write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988.</p>
      <p>In the last two years we made a good start in continuing the work of
         welfare reform. Our Administration gave two dozen states the right to
         slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare
         systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and
         dependency.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Last year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever
            presented by an Administration. We have to make welfare what it was
            meant to be--a second chance, not a way of life.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to
            provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for
            up to two years. But after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule.</span>
         Anyone who can work must go to work.</p>
      <p>If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay.</p>
      <p>We should suspend driver's licenses, track them across state lines, make
         them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do
         not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility
         for the children they bring into this world.</p>
      <p>I want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. <span class="poverty">But
            our goal must be to liberate people and lift them from dependence to
            independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to
            responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because
            they happen to be poor.</span></p>
      <p>We should--we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we
         shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young or
         even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by
         requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other
         supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we
         shouldn't put them and their children out on the street.</p>
      <p>And I know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought
         about this for a long time: I still don't think we can, in good
         conscience, punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American
         people care about this, without regard to party or race or region. So
         let this be the year we end welfare as we know it.</p>
      <p>But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this
         issue to divide America.</p>
      <p>No one is more eager to end welfare.</p>
      <p>I may be the only President who's actually had the opportunity to sit in
         the welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to
         people on welfare, and I am telling you the people who are trapped on it
         know it doesn't work. They also want to get off.</p>
      <p>So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I
         have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a
         worker or a student or a responsible parent. <span class="poverty">I just don't want to punish
            poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes and none of
            us can change our yesterdays, but every one of us can change our
            tomorrows.</span></p>
      <p>And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her
         way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the state of California.</p>
      <p>Crime</p>
      <p>I know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are
         all the citizens of our country. But I remind you that last year we
         passed a very tough crime bill--longer sentences, three strikes and
         you're out, almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons,
         more prevention, 100,000 more police--and we paid for it all by reducing
         the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local
         communities to lower the crime rate.</p>
      <p>There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be
         smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well if there are,
         let's talk about them and let's do them. But let's not go back on the
         things that we did last year that we know work--that we know work
         because the local law-enforcement officers tell us that we did the right
         thing. Because local community leaders, who've worked for years and
         years to lower the crime rate, tell us that they work.</p>
      <p>Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the
         crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it
         and if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate, and
         I am convinced that it does, let us not go back on it, let's stick with
         it, implement it--we've got four more hard years of work to do to do
         that.</p>
      <p>I don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the
         country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body
         greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and in
         the crime bill the ban on 19 assault weapons.</p>
      <p>I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several members
         of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they
         voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you that are here
         because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I
         just have to tell you how I feel about it.</p>
      <p>The members who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to
         infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in
         other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy,
         and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore.</p>
      <p>But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police
         officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of
         assault-weapon attacks, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not
         let it be repealed.</p>
      <p>I'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I
         want us to cut more spending, <span class="economy">but I hope we won't cut Government
            programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote
            responsibility and are organized from the grass roots up, not by Federal
            bureaucracy.</span></p>
      <p>The very best example of this is the National Service Corps--AmeriCorps.
         It passed with strong bipartisan support and now there are 20,000
         Americans --more than ever served in one year in the Peace
         Corps--working all over this country, helping person to person in local
         grass-roots volunteer groups, solving problems and in the process
         earning some money for their education.</p>
      <p>This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members,
         but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New
         Covenant and we shouldn't stop it.</p>
      <p>Illegal Immigration</p>
      <p>All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in
         every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers
         of illegal aliens entering our country.</p>
      <p>The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal
         immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our
         taxpayers. That's why our Administration has moved aggressively to
         secure our borders more, by hiring a record number of new border guards,
         by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking
         down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.</p>
      <p>In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the
         deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better
         identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the
         commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.</p>
      <p>We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is
         wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit
         the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years,
         and we must do more to stop it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower
            the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always
            been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get
            ahead. We've become a great middle-class country; middle-class values
            sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass
            even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who
            are already successful in the new economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">America is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost six
            million new jobs in the last two years, exports booming, inflation down,
            high-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American
            entrepreneurs are living the American dream.</span></p>
      <p>If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our nation must
         have more of its benefits.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Today, too many of those people are being left out. They're working
            harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty
            that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids
            or retirement for themselves.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably
            keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth
            began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale. And the
            people in the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked
            like crazy but were on the bottom then, fell even further and further
            behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this
            new economy work for all of our people,</span> a Government that helps each and
         every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew
         our skills.</p>
      <p>Education</p>
      <p>That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in
         the last two years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships
         for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more
         available and more affordable.</p>
      <p>That's the first thing we have to do: We've got to do something to
         empower people to improve their skills.</p>
      <p>Taxes</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes
            immediately by lowering their taxes.</span></p>
      <p>We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15
         million families with incomes under $ 27,000, a tax cut that this year
         will average about $ 1,000 a family.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before
            we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we
            inherited and we had to get economic growth up.</span> Now we've done both, and
         now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way.</p>
      <p>But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to
         empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of
         their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right
         choices for themselves, their families and their communities.</p>
      <p>Middle Class Bill Of Rights</p>
      <p>I have proposed a middle-class bill of rights, which should properly be
         called the bill of rights and responsibilities, because its provisions
         only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children
         and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief
         and raise incomes, in both the short run and the long run, in a way that
         benefits all of us.</p>
      <p>There are four provisions:</p>
      <p>First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school.
         If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment,
         we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but
         today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of
         our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we
         can to encourage it, and I hope you will support it.</p>
      <p>Second, we ought to cut taxes $ 500 for families with children under 13.</p>
      <p>Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by
         permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and
         withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care,
         first-time home buying or the care of a parent.</p>
      <p>And fourth, we should pass a G.I. bill for America's workers. We propose
         to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the
         states but give the money directly to the American people, offer
         vouchers to them so that they--if they're laid off or if they're working
         for a very low wage--can get a voucher worth $ 2,600 a year for up to
         two years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they
         want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower
         people in this way. Move it from the Government directly to the workers
         of America.</p>
      <p>Cutting The Deficit Now</p>
      <p>Any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that
         explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for
         our tax cuts fully and honestly. Just two years ago it was an open
         question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom
         didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said
         would not be done: <span class="economy">We cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion, about $
            10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down three years in
            a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President and I don't
            think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.</span></p>
      <p>In the budget I will send you, the middle-class bill of rights is fully
         paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in
         special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double
         the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle-class bill of rights without
         any cuts in Medicare, and I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts
         with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief. And some
         of them, I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of
         you.</p>
      <p>My tests for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise
         incomes? Will it strengthen our families and support our children? Is it
         paid for? Will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass?</p>
      <p>If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.</p>
      <p>Minimum Wage</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is
            also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">It rewards work--two and a half million Americans, often women with
            children, are working out there today for four-and-a-quarter an hour. In
            terms of real buying power, by next year, that minimum wage will be at a
            40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now I studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a
            minimum-wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a
            modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into
            the job market.</span> <span class="poverty">But the most important thing is you can't make a living
            on $ 4.25 an hour. Now --especially if you have children, even with the
            working families tax cut we passed last year.</span></p>
      <p>In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it
         should be again. <span class="poverty">So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on
            this, to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living
            wage.</span></p>
      <p>Members of Congress have been here less than a month but by the end of
         the week--28 days into the new year--every member of Congress will have
         earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum-wage worker makes
         all year long.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Everybody else here, including the President, has something else that
            too many Americans do without and that's health care.</span></p>
      <p>Health Care</p>
      <p>Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't
         do anything. <span class="poverty">And the cold, hard fact is that since last year--since I
            was here--another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost
            their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions
            more--most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed
            people--have seen their premiums skyrocket, their co-pays and
            deductibles go up.</span></p>
      <p>There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics
         have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper
         that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.</p>
      <p>Now I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health
         security for every American family, but--but I know that last year, as
         the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew.</p>
      <p>So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's
         do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass
         meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage
         for facing skyrocketing prices but that nobody loses their coverage
         because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change
         jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.</p>
      <p>I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this:
         with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican
         leaders like Senator Dole who has a longtime commitment to health care
         reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We
         ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy
         insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools.
         We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent to a
         disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least
         keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for
         work, and we can find a way--it may take some time, but we can find a
         way--to make sure that our children have health care.</p>
      <p>You know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can
         be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's
         most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade, but we
         can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the
         world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children
         with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago--the last time we
         were the most productive economy in the world.</p>
      <p>So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as
         usual.</p>
      <p>Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what
         we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security
         concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders, they
         relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our
         children, our streets, our health and protecting those borders.</p>
      <p>Foreign Policy</p>
      <p><span class="war">Now that the Cold War has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the
            security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at
            home. But it's not so. Our security still depends on our continued world
            leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong
            at home unless we're strong abroad.</span></p>
      <p>Mexico</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not
            popular to say it tonight but we have to act, not for the Mexican people
            but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied
            to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve
            American exports, safeguard America's borders then we must pass the
            stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.</span></p>
      <p>Now let me repeat: it's not a loan, it's not foreign aid, it's not a
         bail-out. We'll be given a guarantee like co-signing a note with good
         collateral that will cover our risk.</p>
      <p>This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the
         bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will
         pass it quickly. It is in our interest and we can explain it to the
         American people, because we're going to do it in the right way.</p>
      <p>Russia</p>
      <p><span class="war">You know, tonight this is the first State of the Union address ever
            delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian
            missile is pointed at the children of America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles
            and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so
            fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of
            the nuclear threat for granted.</span> But it's still there, and we aren't
         finished yet.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This year, I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons
            that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge
            to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to enact a
            comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons.</span></p>
      <p>North Korea</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program,
            we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that
            nation. It's smart, it's tough, it's a deal based on continuing
            inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.</span></p>
      <p>This year, I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to
         strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home
         or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out,
         this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.</p>
      <p>Middle East</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and
            injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I
            send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in
            the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to
            go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We
            must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her
            neighbors in the Middle East.</span></p>
      <p>Accordingly, last night I signed an executive order that will block the
         assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to
         disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with
         these groups.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">And tonight I call on all our allies in peace-loving nations throughout
            the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat
            terrorism, we cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear
            and paralysis.</span></p>
      <p>Defense</p>
      <p><span class="war">From the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our nation would
            maintain the best-equipped, best-trained and best-prepared military on
            earth. We have and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing
            of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But
            to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and
            the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking
            the Congress to add $ 25 billion in defense spending over the next six
            years.</span></p>
      <p>I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became
         President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask
         a very great deal of our armed forces. Now that they are smaller in
         number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different
         places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways,
         and we must give them and their families what the times demand and what
         they have earned.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Just think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing
            America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in
            Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to
            Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti.</span></p>
      <p>We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South
         Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia,
         from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in
         those places but they make our future more confident and more secure.</p>
      <p>Well, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future:
         expanding opportunity not bureaucracy, enhancing security at home and
         abroad, empowering our people to make the most of their own lives.</p>
      <p>It's ambitious and achievable. But it's not enough.</p>
      <p>We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping
         Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's
         smaller, smarter and wiser, more than all the changes we can make in
         Government and in the private sector from the outside in.</p>
      <p>Values And Voices</p>
      <p>Our fortunes and our prosperity also depend upon our ability to answer
         some questions from within--from the values and voices that speak to our
         hearts as well as our heads, voices that tell us we have to do more to
         accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our
         communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p>We see our families and our communities all over this country coming
         apart. And we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA,
         the town hall meeting, the ball park--it's hard for a lot of overworked
         parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the
         bonds of trust and cooperation.</p>
      <p>Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who
         can give them those experiences that they need to build their own
         character and their sense of identity. We all know that while we here in
         this chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real
         differences will be made by our fellow citizens where they work and
         where they live.</p>
      <p>And it'll be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to
         the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league and
         people would come up to me--fathers and mothers--and talk to me, I can
         honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans
         or Democrats.</p>
      <p>When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California,
         Northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something
         that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, "Mr. President,
         I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here."</p>
      <p>Now, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act
         every day. Because as we move into this next century, everybody matters.
         We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of
         chances to do better.</p>
      <p>That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody--for our corporate
         and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the
         deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every
         possible way. But they have an obligation: when they're doing well, to
         keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the
         prosperity they generate.</p>
      <p>For people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud
         your creativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom
         of expression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of
         your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant,
         repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates
         our media all the time.</p>
      <p>We've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to
         help us stop our most serious social problem: the epidemic of teen
         pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to
         Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with
         anti-pregnancy programs that work. But government can only do so much.
         Tonight, I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join
         together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a
         difference. We can do this and we must.</p>
      <p>And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You
         know, I'm proud of the fact that the United States has more house of
         worship per capita than any country in the world. These people, who lead
         our houses of worship, can ignite their congregations to carry their
         faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the
         people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of
         all we hold dear, because so much of what must be done must come from
         the inside out. And our religious leaders and their congregations can
         make all the difference. They have a role in the New Covenant as well.</p>
      <p>There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know it
         takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the
         streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for
         Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a
         lot of people to provide the people power for all the civic
         organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to
         most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the
         children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to
         learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe
         that they can be whatever they want to be.</p>
      <p>I know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under
         great stress, to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the
         time or the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship.
         Most of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly
         treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of
         political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads--either
         promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and
         frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their
         information in very negative and aggressive ways that is hardly
         conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is we have got
         to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different
         views.</p>
      <p>If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of
         America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time
         ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were
         different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And
         in this day everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply
         cannot wait for a tornado, a fire or a flood to behave like Americans
         ought to behave in dealing with one another.</p>
      <p>I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the
         First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about. Citizens. I
         have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in
         the last election, but they represent what we ought to be doing.</p>
      <p>Cindy Perry teaches second-graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural
         Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four.</p>
      <p>She says that her service inspired her to get her high school
         equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teen-ager. Stand
         up, Cindy. She married when she was a teen-ager. She had four children,
         but she had time to serve other people, to get her high school
         equivalency and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to
         college.</p>
      <p>Steven Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national
         leader--stand up Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police
         in community policing and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it, and the
         crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Cpl. Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's
            force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add we
            must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and
            taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to
            the people, and he was one of them and we're proud of him.</span></p>
      <p>The next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a
         little bit. The Rev. John and the Rev. Diana Cherry of the A.M.E. Zion
         Church in Temple Hills, Md. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to
         tell you about them. In the early 80's they left Government service and
         formed a church in a small living room in a small house in the early
         80's. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or
         four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a
         month.</p>
      <p>They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping
         families together. They are--Two things they did make a big impression
         on me. I visited their church once and I learned they were building a
         new sanctuary closer to the Washington, D.C., line, in a higher-crime,
         higher-drug-rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry
         to change the lives of the people who needed them. Second thing I want
         to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House
         with some other religious leaders and he left early to go back to his
         church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church
         from all over America to convince them to come back together to save
         their marriages and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that
         citizens are doing in America. We need more of it and it ought to be
         lifted up and supported.</p>
      <p>The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg,
         Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up. Fifty years ago in the sands of
         Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On
         February the 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the
         enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both
         of them. In that moment he saved the lives of his companions and
         miraculously in the next instant a medic saved his life. He gained a
         foothold for freedom and at the age of 17, just a year older than his
         grandson, who's up there with him today, and his son, who is a West
         Point graduate and a veteran, at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest
         marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the
         Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's
         what he said about that day: Didn't matter where you were from or who
         you were. You relied on one another. You did it for your country. We all
         gain when we give and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this
         New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity and citizenship.</p>
      <p>More than stale chapters in some remote civic book they're still the
         virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given
         potential and be like them. And also to fulfill the eternal promise of
         this country, the enduring dream from that first and most-sacred
         covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we
         are created equal and given by our creator the right to life, liberty
         and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
      <p>This is a very, very great country and our best days are still to come.
         Thank you and God bless you all.

      <h3>January 23, 1996</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th Congress,
         distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land:</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around
            the world, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to
            their families, I thank you. America is very, very proud of you.</span></p>
      <p>My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union--not the state of
         our government, but of our American community; and to set forth our
         responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect
         union.</p>
      <p>The state of the Union is strong. <span class="economy">Our economy is the healthiest it has
            been in three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment
            and inflation in 27 years. We have created nearly 8 million new jobs,
            over a million of them in basic industries, like construction and
            automobiles. America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time
            since the 1970s. And for three years in a row, we have had a record
            number of new businesses started in our country.</span></p>
      <p>Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace.
         And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our
         fundamental values. <span class="poverty">The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls,
            the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate are all down.</span> And as they
         go down, prospects for America's future go up.</p>
      <p>We live in an age of possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from farm
         to factory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global
         competition. These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our
         people, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges. While
         more Americans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are
         working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the
         security of their families.</p>
      <p>The Role Of Government</p>
      <p>We must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make
         the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans
         who are willing to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and
         enduring values as we move into the future? And, third, how do we meet
         these challenges together, as one America?</p>
      <p>We know big government does not have all the answers. We know there's
         not a program for every problem. We have worked to give the American
         people a smaller, less bureaucratic government in Washington. And we
         have to give the American people one that lives within its means.</p>
      <p>The era of big government is over. But we cannot go back to the time
         when our citizens were left to fend for themselves. Instead, we must go
         forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the
         challenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing
         virtues; we must have both.</p>
      <p>I believe our new, smaller government must work in an old-fashioned
         American way, together with all of our citizens through state and local
         governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable and civic
         associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most
         of their own lives--with stronger families, more educational
         opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in
         a safer world.</p>
      <p>To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we
         must expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges
         together.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget
            in a way that is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan
            agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy
            and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget.
            And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan
            in history in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in
            three years.</span></p>
      <p>Deficit</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction.
            Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to
            invest and to create new jobs. Lower interest rates have brought down
            the cost of home mortgages, car payments and credit card rates to
            ordinary citizens. Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the
            budget.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Though differences remain among us which are significant, the combined
            total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than
            enough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to
            balance the budget in seven years and to provide a modest tax cut.</span></p>
      <p>These cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But
         these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents,
         our children, and our future, by endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or
         education, or the environment, or by raising taxes on working families.</p>
      <p>I have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out
         of our negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans
         and Democrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the
         good ideas that we could all embrace.</p>
      <p>We ought to resolve our remaining differences. I am willing to work to
         resolve them. I am ready to meet tomorrow. <span class="economy">But I ask you to consider
            that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in
            common and give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut,
            lower interest rates, and a brighter future. We should do that now, and
            make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.</span></p>
      <p>Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and
         tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are
         significant. But America was built on challenges, not promises. And when
         we work together to meet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more
         perfect Union. Our individual dreams must be realized by our common
         efforts.</p>
      <p>Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a
         people.</p>
      <p>Strengthening Families</p>
      <p>Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's
         families. Family is the foundation of American life. If we have stronger
         families, we will have a stronger America.</p>
      <p>Before I go on, I would like to take just a moment to thank my own
         family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else
         over 25 years about the importance of families and children--a wonderful
         wife, a magnificent mother and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary.</p>
      <p>All strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our
         children. I have heard Mrs. Gore say that it's hard to be a parent
         today, but it's even harder to be a child. So all of us, not just as
         parents, but all of us in our other roles--our media, our schools, our
         teachers, our communities, our churches and synagogues, our businesses,
         our governments--all of us have a responsibility to help our children to
         make it and to make the most of their lives and their God-given
         capacities.</p>
      <p>To the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and television
         shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy.</p>
      <p>I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so
         that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for
         their children. When parents control what their young children see, that
         is not censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal
         responsibility for their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do
         it. The V-chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications
         bill now pending in this Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge
         you to pass it now.</p>
      <p>To make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what
         movies have done--to identify your programming in ways that help parents
         to protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media
         corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House
         next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve
         what our children see on television. I am ready to work with you.</p>
      <p>I say to those who make and market cigarettes: every year a million
         children take up smoking, even though it is against the law. Three
         hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result.
         Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing
         campaigns that appeal to our children. We are simply saying: Market your
         products to adults, if you wish, but draw the line on children.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been
            trapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has
            undermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them.
            The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform. We
            agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible
            child support enforcement. But I believe we must also provide child care
            so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without
            worrying about what is happening to their children.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill
            that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing
            by our children. I will sign it immediately.</span></p>
      <p>Let us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the
         best possible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it
         work. <span class="poverty">I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity
            for independence. I challenge American businesses to give people on
            welfare the chance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of
            religious groups and others who care for the poor. More than anyone else
            in our society, they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and
            they are in a position to help. Every one of us should join them. That
            is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives
            of the American people.</span></p>
      <p>To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen
         pregnancy rate going down. I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans
         are, that it has dropped for two years in a row. But we all know it is
         still far too high.</p>
      <p>Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is
         responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will
         support grass-roots community efforts all across our country in a
         national campaign against teen pregnancy. And I challenge all of us and
         every American to join their efforts.</p>
      <p>I call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to
         one another. We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our
         country. And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay
         together. <span class="economy">For families who stay together not only do better
            economically, their children do better as well.</span></p>
      <p>In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care
         for their children. If your family has separated, you must pay your
         child support. We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're
         going to do more, but let's all admit something about that, too: A check
         will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance. And only you--only
         you can make the decision to help raise your children. No matter who you
         are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic human
         duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability.</p>
      <p>Education</p>
      <p>Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational
         opportunities we will all need for this new century. In our schools,
         every classroom in America must be connected to the information
         superhighway, with computers and good software, and well-trained
         teachers. We are working with the telecommunications industry, educators
         and parents to connect 20 percent of California's classrooms by this
         spring, and every classroom and every library in the entire United
         States by the year 2000. I ask Congress to support this education
         technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership
         succeeds.</p>
      <p>Every diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community,
         every school and every state to adopt national standards of excellence;
         to measure whether schools are meeting those standards; to cut
         bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility
         for grass-roots reform; and to hold them accountable for results. That's
         what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about.</p>
      <p>I challenge every state to give all parents the right to choose which
         public school their children will attend; and to let teachers form new
         schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job.</p>
      <p>I challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good
         values and good citizenship. And if it means that teenagers will stop
         killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should
         be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.</p>
      <p>I challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers. Turn
         off the TV. See that the homework is done. And visit your children's
         classroom. No program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever
         before. <span class="economy">We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier
            to borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the
            student loan default rate. That's something we should all be proud of,
            because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago.</span> Through
         AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 young people
         will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve
         the lives of their friends and neighbors. These initiatives are right
         for America and we should keep them going.</p>
      <p>And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider. I
         challenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young
         Americans work their way through college by the year 2000; to provide a
         $1000 merit scholarship for the top five percent of graduates in every
         high school in the United States; to expand Pell Grant scholarships for
         deserving and needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of
         college tuition tax deductible. It's a good idea for America.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for
            it, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard
            still need support to get ahead in the new economy.</span> They need education
         and training for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising
         children. They need retirement security. They need access to health
         care. More and more Americans are finding that the education of their
         childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime.</p>
      <p>G.I. Bill For Workers</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated
            job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed
            or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college
            tuition or other training.</span> This is a G.I. Bill for America's workers we
         should all be able to agree on.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">More and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets
            the minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year
            low in purchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer
            a living wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying
            to live on it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working</span>
         <span class="poverty">families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to
            raise their children in poverty, and to encourage people to move from
            welfare to work.</span> This expanded earned income tax credit is now worth
         about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000. The budget
         bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on
         nearly 8 million of these people. We should not do that.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">I also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are
            not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job
            raising their children and at work.</span> I agree that we need a tax credit
         for working families with children. That's one of the things most of us
         in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported
         by the Republican majority. <span class="economy">And it should be part of any final budget
            agreement.</span></p>
      <p>I want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to
         provide pensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a
         proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business
         that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish
         their own pension plans. That is something we should all agree on.</p>
      <p>We should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with
         bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle,
         we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to
         stabilize the pensions of 32 million more. <span class="economy">Congress should not now let
            companies endanger those workers' pension funds. I know the proposal to
            liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds
            for other purposes would raise money for the treasury. But I believe it
            is false economy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to
            do so again.</span></p>
      <p>Health Care</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new
            economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do
            not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets
            sick. Over the past two years, over one million Americans in working
            families have lost their health insurance. We have to do more to make
            health care available to every American.</span> And Congress should start by
         passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator
         Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people
         when they switch jobs, and stop denying coverage for preexisting
         conditions. Let's all do that.</p>
      <p>And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common
         commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and
         Medicaid--not just to the poor, but to people in working families,
         including children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, and
         senior citizens in nursing homes.</p>
      <p>In the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health
         care fraud and abuse. We have all agreed to save much more. We have all
         agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund. But we must not abandon our
         fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid.
         America cannot become stronger if they become weaker.</p>
      <p>The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing,
         pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation
         of Medicare and Medicaid--these things, along with the Family and
         Medical Leave Act passed in 1993--these things will help responsible,
         hard-working American families to make the most of their own lives.</p>
      <p>But employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are
         doing in so many of our finest companies--working together, putting the
         long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain. As workers increase
         their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get
         the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well
         as the burdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a
         team they do better, and so does America.</p>
      <p>Crime</p>
      <p>Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and
         gangs and drugs. At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime,
         forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch
         criminals and prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing,
         is clearly working. Violent crime is coming down all across America. In
         New York City murders are down 25 percent; in St. Louis, 18 percent; in
         Seattle, 32 percent. But we still have a long way to go before our
         streets are safe and our people are free from fear.</p>
      <p>The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing.
         It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes.
         We're already a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to
         finish the job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the
         crime rate coming down.</p>
      <p>Community policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and
         police. I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement
         officers. And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models
         and heroes. Don't let them down.</p>
      <p>The Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records
         from buying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault
         weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge the Congress to
         keep those laws on the books.</p>
      <p>Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we
         once took on the mob. I'm directing the FBI and other investigative
         agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles in violent crime, and to
         seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like
         adults.</p>
      <p>And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations:
         Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of
         decent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and
         peddle drugs should be one strike and you're out.</p>
      <p>I challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious
         violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.</p>
      <p>More police and punishment are important, but they're not enough. We
         have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with
         prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but developed in
         communities. I challenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to
         give our children futures to say yes to. And I challenge Congress not to
         abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-roots prevention
         efforts.</p>
      <p>Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug
         problem. The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to
         their children openly and firmly. It embraces our churches and
         synagogues, our youth groups and our schools.</p>
      <p>I challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools.
         People like the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade
         schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time
         comes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into
         America. For the last two years, one man in particular has been on the
         front lines of that effort. Tonight I am nominating him--a hero of the
         Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States
         Military Southern Command--General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new
         Drug Czar.</p>
      <p>General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars
         fighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's
         battle against drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force
         far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every
         one of us has a role to play on this team.</p>
      <p>Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one
         more time.</p>
      <p>Environment</p>
      <p>Our fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the
         next generation. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have
         cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by
         70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was
         dead, and now it's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12
         still live within four miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us
         breathe air that endangers our health. And in too many communities, the
         water is not safe to drink. We still have much to do.</p>
      <p>Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent.
         That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more
         pesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to
         write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the
         health and safety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should
         pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix
         it off the hook. I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to
         reverse them.</p>
      <p>This issue has not been a partisan issue. The most significant
         environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic
         Congress and President Richard Nixon. We can work together. We have to
         believe some basic things.<span class="economy"> Do you believe we can expand the economy
            without hurting the environment?</span> I do. Do you believe we can create more
         jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up? I know we can.
         That should be our commitment.</p>
      <p>We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in
         protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do
         it. To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a
         cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet
         tough pollution standards, do it--as long as you do it right. To
         communities we say: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws
         requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you have to use the
         information to work with business to cut pollution. People do have a
         right to know that their air and their water are safe.</p>
      <p>Foreign Policy</p>
      <p>Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for
         freedom and peace throughout the world. Because of American leadership,
         more people than ever before live free and at peace. And Americans have
         known 50 years of prosperity and security.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like
            to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought
            in World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have
            fought bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service, and so
            do the American people.</span></p>
      <p>All over the world, even after the Cold War, people still look to us and
         trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom. But as
         the Cold War fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should
         retreat from its responsibilities. I say they are wrong.</p>
      <p>The threats we face today as Americans respect no nation's borders.
         Think of them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
         organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred,
         aggression by rogue states, environmental degradation. If we fail to
         address these threats today, we will suffer the consequences in all our
         tomorrows.</p>
      <p>Of course, we can't be everywhere. Of course, we can't do everything.
         But where our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can
         make a difference, America must lead. We must not be isolationist.</p>
      <p>We must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the
         world's very best peacemaker.<span class="war"> By keeping our military strong, by using
            diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others
            to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a
            difference for people here and around the world. For the first time
            since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single Russian missile
            pointed at America's children</span>.</p>
      <p>North Korea</p>
      <p><span class="war">North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In
            Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of
            desperate refugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade
            deals for America--over 80 of them--we have opened markets abroad, and
            now exports are at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and
            creating good American jobs.</span></p>
      <p>Northern Ireland</p>
      <p>We stood with those taking risks for peace: In Northern Ireland, where
         Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must
         never return. In the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed
         destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources, and even
         dreams.</p>
      <p>Bosnia</p>
      <p>And we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners,
         the mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of
         refugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these
         horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. <span class="diplomacy">Now, our
            troops and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from Central
            Europe and elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold.</span></p>
      <p>As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional
         group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing, but of
         the pride they evidenced in what they were doing. They knew what
         America's mission in this world is, and they were proud to be carrying
         it out.</p>
      <p>Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American
         people. But make no mistake about it: important challenges remain.</p>
      <p>Russia</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by
            another 25 percent. I urge the Senate to ratify it--now. We must end the
            race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive
            nuclear test ban treaty--this year.</span></p>
      <p>As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw
         poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons
         Convention--this year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and
         organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the
         anti-terrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City
         bombing--now. We can help more people move from hatred to hope all
         across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to
         remain the world's leader for peace.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for
         all of us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those
         of us in this hallowed hall tonight: to reinvent our government and make
         our democracy work for them.</p>
      <p>Reform</p>
      <p>Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to
         everyone else. This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. This
         Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation
         they are trying to pass or kill. This Congress did that, and I applaud
         you for it.</p>
      <p>Now I challenge Congress to go further--to curb special interest
         influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign
         reform bill in a generation. You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can
         show the American people that we can limit spending and open the
         airwaves to all candidates.</p>
      <p>I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the
         American people.</p>
      <p>Our administration is working hard to give the American people a
         government that works better and costs less. Thanks to the work of Vice
         President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and
         regulations, shifting more decision-making out of Washington, back to
         states and local communities.</p>
      <p>As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government, we
         must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own
         lives. We are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy,
         but with more opportunities. Through our successful Empowerment Zones
         and Community Development Banks, we are helping people to find jobs, to
         start businesses. And with tax incentives for companies that clean up
         abandoned industrial property, we can bring jobs back to places that
         desperately, desperately need them.</p>
      <p>But there are some areas that the federal government should not leave
         and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the
         problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this
         administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our
         borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are
         increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And
         tonight, I announce I will sign an executive order to deny federal
         contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p>Let me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we
         should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here,
         working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws.</p>
      <p>I want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal
         government. Today our federal government is 200,000 employees smaller
         than it was the day I took office as President.</p>
      <p>Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years,
         and it's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans
         probably don't know that. And there is a good reason: The remaining
         federal work force is composed of Americans who are now working harder
         and working smarter than ever before, to make sure the quality of our
         services does not decline.</p>
      <p>I'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49
         year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security
         Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the
         Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and
         brought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four
         times. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this
         evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public
         service and his extraordinary personal heroism.</p>
      <p>But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was
         forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second
         time the government shut down he continued helping Social Security
         recipients, but he was working without pay.</p>
      <p>On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who
         are out there working every day doing a good job for the American
         people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber: Never, ever shut the
         federal government down again.</p>
      <p>On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social
         Security payments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the
         Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States--to
         honor the obligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years; to
         rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt
         limit and show people America keeps its word.</p>
      <p>I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, and even more
         from America. But I am confident: When Americans work together in their
         homes, their schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic
         groups, their workplace, they can meet any challenge.</p>
      <p>I say again, the era of big government is over. But we can't go back to
         the era of fending for yourself. We have to go forward to the era of
         working together as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of
         us reaching across these lines that divide us--the division, the
         discrimination, the rancor--we have to reach across it to find common
         ground. We have got to work together if we want America to work.</p>
      <p>I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that. Lucius
         Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system. A
         Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn
         away from gangs and build futures they can believe in. Sergeant Jennifer
         Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City. Like Richard Dean, she
         helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that
         awful tragedy. She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity
         the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of
         decency and community.</p>
      <p>Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans. And I have the
         honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several
         thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its
         long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics
         in Atlanta this summer--not because they are star athletes, but because
         they are star citizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges.
         They are our real champions.</p>
      <p>Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own
         lives. None of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our
         destiny together--one hand, one generation, one American connecting to
         another.</p>
      <p>There have always been things we could do together--dreams we could make
         real--which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have
         forged our identity, our very union, from every point of view and every
         point on the planet, every different opinion. But we must be bound
         together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us--by
         our belief in progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search
         for common ground.</p>
      <p>America has always sought and always risen to every challenge. Who would
         say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?
         Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans?</p>
      <p>Our country is and always has been a great and good nation. But the best
         is yet to come, if we all do our part.</p>
      <p>Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
         Thank you.

      <h3>February 4, 1997</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress,
         distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>I think I should start by saying thanks for inviting me back.</p>
      <p>I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our
         peacetime history--and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to
         prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have much to be thankful for. With four years of growth, we have won
            back the basic strength of our economy.</span> <span class="poverty">With crime and welfare rolls
            declining, we are winning back our optimism, the enduring faith that we
            can master any difficulty.</span> <span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">With the Cold War receding and global
               commerce at record levels, we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and
               prosperity all across the world.</span></span></p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, the state of our union is strong, but now we must
         rise to the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than
         any we have ever known.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">The new promise of the global economy,</span></span> the Information Age, unimagined
         new work, life-enhancing technology--all these are ours to seize. That
         is our honor and our challenge. We must be shapers of events, not
         observers, for if we do not act, the moment will pass and we will lose
         the best possibilities of our future.</p>
      <p>We face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy. The enemy of our
         time is inaction.</p>
      <p>So tonight I issue a call to action--action by this Congress, action by
         our states, by our people to prepare America for the 21st century;
         <span class="economy">action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all
            our people;</span> action to strengthen education and harness the forces of
         technology and science; action to build stronger families and stronger
         communities and a safer environment; <span class="diplomacy">action to keep America the world's
            strongest force for peace, freedom and prosperity;</span> and above all, action
         to build a more perfect union here at home.</p>
      <p>The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference.</p>
      <p>We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans,
         responsibility from all Americans in a community of all Americans. And
         we must be committed to a new kind of government: not to solve all our
         problems for us, but to give our people--all our people--the tools they
         need to make the most of their own lives. And we must work together.</p>
      <p>The people of this nation elected us all. They want us to be partners,
         not partisans. They put us all right here in the same boat. They gave us
         all oars, and they told us to row. Now, here is the direction I believe
         we should take.</p>
      <p>First, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our
         country: <span class="economy">to balance the budget,</span> renew our democracy, <span class="economy">and finish the job
            of welfare reform.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Over the last four years we have brought new economic growth by
            investing in our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits,
            creating over 11 million new jobs, a four-year record.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world. We here tonight
            have an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be the Congress that
            finally balances the budget.</span> Thank you.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In two days I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by
            2002. This plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while
            protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It will
            balance the budget and build on the vice president's efforts to make our
            government work better--even as it costs less.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">It will balance the budget and provide middle-class tax relief to pay
            for education and health care, to help to raise a child, to buy and sell
            a home.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does
            not require us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe, I believe it is
            both unnecessary, unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could
            cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted
            results such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing
            taxes.</span></p>
      <p>Let us at least agree we should not pass any measure, no measure should
         be passed that threatens Social Security. We don't need, whatever your
         view on that, we all must concede we don't need a constitutional
         amendment, we need action. <span class="economy">Whatever our differences, we should balance
            the budget now,</span> and then, for the long-term health of our society, we
         must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and
         reform Medicare for the long run, so that these fundamental programs
         will be as strong for our children as they are for our parents.</p>
      <p>And let me say something that's not in my script tonight. I know this is
         not going to be easy. But I really believe one of the reasons the
         American people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in
         the next four years that will carry our country through the next 50
         years. I know it is easier for me than for you to say or do. But another
         reason I was elected is to support all of you, without regard to party,
         to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions. We owe it to
         our country and to our future.</p>
      <p>Our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves
         tonight, before the eyes of America, to finally enacting bipartisan
         campaign finance reform.</p>
      <p>Now, Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan have
         reached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform. Their
         proposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special interests,
         create a level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and ban
         contributions from non-citizens, all corporate sources, and the other
         large soft-money contributions that both parties receive.</p>
      <p>You know and I know that this can be delayed, and you know and I know
         that delay will mean the death of reform.</p>
      <p>So let's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan
         campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we
         celebrate the birth of our democracy, July the 4th.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">There is a third piece of unfinished business. Over the last four years
            we moved a record two and a quarter million people off the welfare
            roles. Then last year Congress enacted landmark welfare reform
            legislation demanding that all able-bodied recipients assume the
            responsibility of moving from welfare to work. Now each and every one of
            us has to fulfill our responsibility, indeed our moral obligation, to
            make sure that people who now must work can work. And now we must act to
            meet a new goal: two million more people off the welfare rolls by the
            year 2000.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that
               hire people off welfare; Incentives for job placement firms in states to
               create more jobs for welfare recipients; Training, transportation and
               child care to help people go to work. Now I challenge every state--turn
               those welfare checks into private sector paychecks. I challenge every
               religious congregation, every community nonprofit, every business to
               hire someone off welfare. And I'd like to say especially to every
               employer in our country who ever criticized the old welfare system, you
               can't blame that old system anymore; we have torn it down. Now, do your
               part. Give someone on welfare the chance to go to work.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">Tonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations--Sprint,
               Monsanto, UPS, Burger King and United Airlines--will be the first to
               join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses large and
               small to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We passed welfare reform. All of you know I believe we were right to do
            it.</span> But no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience
         unless you are prepared to finish the job.</p>
      <p>And we must join together to do something else, too, something both
         Republican and Democratic governors have asked us to do: to restore
         basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants
         who came to this country legally, who work hard, <span class="economy">pay taxes</span>, and obey the
         law. To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants.</p>
      <p>Now, looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold to the
         future we must now cross, and my number one priority for the next four
         years, is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the
         world. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Let's work together to meet these three goals: every eight-year-old must
         be able to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the
         Internet, every 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every
         adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">My balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals--$51
            billion next year--but far more than money is required.</span> I have a plan, a
         call to action for American education based on these 10 principles:</p>
      <p>First, a national crusade for education standards--not federal
         government standards, but national standards, representing what all our
         students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st
         century. Every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect
         these standards and train teachers to lift students up to them. To help
         schools meet the standards and measure their progress, we will lead an
         effort over the next two years to develop national tests of student
         achievement in reading and math.</p>
      <p>Tonight I issue a challenge to the nation. Every state should adopt high
         national standards, and by 1999, every state should test every 4th
         grader in reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these
         standards are met.</p>
      <p>Raising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not be
         able to meet them at first. The point is not to put our children down,
         but to lift them up. Good tests will show us who needs help, what
         changes in teaching to make, and which schools need to improve. They can
         help us end social promotion, for no child should move from grade school
         to junior high or junior high to high school until he or she is ready.</p>
      <p>Last month our secretary of education, Dick Riley, and I visited
         northern Illinois, where 8th grade students from 20 school districts, in
         a project aptly called First in the World, took the third International
         Math and Science Study.</p>
      <p>That's a test that reflects the world-class standards our children must
         meet for the new era. And those students in Illinois tied for first in
         the world in science and came in second in math. Two of them, Kristen
         Tanner and Chris Getsla, are here tonight along with their teacher, Sue
         Winski. They're up there with the first lady, and they prove that when
         we aim high and challenge our students, they will be the best in the
         world. Let's give them a hand. Stand up, please.</p>
      <p>Second, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. Most
         of us in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of
         those teachers. I know that I wouldn't be here.</p>
      <p>For years many of our educators, led by North Carolina's governor, Jim
         Hunt, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have
         worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for
         excellence in teaching.</p>
      <p>Just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995. <span class="economy">My budget
            will enable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master
            teachers.</span> We should reward and recognize our best teachers. And as we
         reward them, we should quickly and fairly remove those few who don't
         measure up, and we should challenge more of our finest young people to
         consider teaching as a career.</p>
      <p>Third, we must do more to help all our children read. Forty percent--40
         percent--of our 8-year-olds cannot read on their own. That's why we have
         just launched the America Reads initiative, to build a citizen army of
         one million volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read
         independently by the end of the 3rd grade. We will use thousands of
         AmeriCorps volunteers to mobilize this citizen army. We want at least
         100,000 college students to help.</p>
      <p>And tonight I'm pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my
         call, pledging that thousands of their work-study students will serve
         for one year as reading tutors.</p>
      <p>This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal.</p>
      <p>You must use these tutors to help your students read. And it is
         especially a challenge to our parents. You must read with your children
         every night.</p>
      <p>This leads to the fourth principle: Learning begins in the first days of
         life. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop
         emotionally and intellectually from their very first days and how
         important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even
         reading to their infants. The first lady has spent years writing about
         this issue, studying it. And she and I are going to convene a White
         House conference on early learning and the brain this spring to explore
         how parents and educators can best use these startling new findings.</p>
      <p>We already know we should start teaching children before they start
         school. <span class="economy">That's why this balanced budget expands Head Start to one
            million children by 2002.</span> And that is why the vice president and Mrs.
         Gore will host their annual family conference this June on what we can
         do to make sure that parents are an active part of their children's
         learning all the way through school.</p>
      <p>They've done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our
         life, and now they're turning their attention to getting more parents
         involved in their children's learning all the way through school. I
         thank you, Mr. Vice President, and I thank you especially, Tipper, for
         what you're doing.</p>
      <p>Fifth, every state should give parents the power to choose the right
         public school for their children. Their right to choose will foster
         competition and innovation that can make public schools better. We
         should also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start
         charter schools, schools that set and meet the highest standards and
         exist only as long as they do.</p>
      <p>Our plan will help America to create 3,000 of these charter schools by
         the next century, nearly seven times as there are in the country today,
         so that parents will have even more choices in sending their children to
         the best schools.</p>
      <p>Sixth, character education must be taught in our schools. We must teach
         our children to be good citizens. And we must continue to promote order
         and discipline; supporting communities that introduce school uniforms,
         impose curfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from
         the classroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Seventh, we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools
            that are literally falling down. With the student population at an
            all-time high, and record numbers of school buildings falling into
            disrepair, this has now become a serious national concern.</span> <span class="economy"><span class="infra">Therefore, my
               budget includes a new initiative: $5 billion to help communities finance
               $20 billion in school construction over the next four years.</span></span></p>
      <p>Eighth, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education--at least two
         years of college--just as universal in America by the 21st century as a
         high school education is today, and we must open the doors of college to
         all Americans.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To do that, I propose America's Hope Scholarship, based on Georgia's
            pioneering program--two years of a $1,500 tax credit for college
            tuition, enough to pay for the typical community college. I also propose
            a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after high
            school, an expanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for education,
            and the largest increase in Pell Grant scholarship in 20 years.</span></p>
      <p>Now this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on
         money they save for college tuition. I ask you to pass it and give every
         American who works hard the chance to go to college.</p>
      <p>Ninth, in the 21st century we must expand the frontiers of learning
         across a lifetime. All our people, of whatever age, must have the chance
         to learn new skills.</p>
      <p>Most Americans live near a community college. The roads that take them
         there can be paths to a better future. <span class="economy">My GI bill for America's workers
            will transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a
            simple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers' hands.</span></p>
      <p>For too long this bill has been sitting on that desk there, without
         action. I ask you to pass it now. Let's give more of our workers the
         ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime.</p>
      <p>Tenth, we must bring the power of the Information Age into all our
         schools.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Last year I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to
            the Internet by the year 2000, so that for the first time in our
            history, children in the most isolated rural town, the most comfortable
            suburbs, the poorest inner-city schools will have the same access to the
            same universe of knowledge.</span></p>
      <p>That is my plan--a call to action for American education. Some may say
         that it is unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to
         education. Some may say it is simply because the president and his
         wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than
         they can recall. That is not what is driving these proposals. We must
         understand the significance of this endeavor.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the Cold War was
            a bipartisan foreign policy.</span> Because our future was at stake, politics
         stopped at the water's edge. Now I ask you, and I ask all our nation's
         governors, I ask parents, teachers and citizens all across America, for
         a new nonpartisan commitment to education, because education is a
         critical national security issue for our future and politics must stop
         at the schoolhouse door.</p>
      <p>To prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful
         forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans. This is the
         first State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet, but
         we've only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that
         should become the modern birthright of every citizen.</p>
      <p>Our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning. <span class="infra">Now we
            should connect every hospital to the Internet so that doctors can
            instantly share data about their patients with the best specialists in
            the field.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every
            children's hospital as soon as possible so that a child in bed can stay
            in touch with school,</span> family and friends. A sick child need no longer be
         a child alone.</p>
      <p>We must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading
         universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds a
         thousand times faster than today to develop new medical treatments, new
         sources of energy, new ways of working together. But we cannot stop
         there.</p>
      <p>As the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home: a
         teacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures. This will no
         longer be a dream, but a necessity. And over the next decade, that must
         be our goal.</p>
      <p>We must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars
         probes and the International Space Station, both of which will have
         practical applications for our everyday living.</p>
      <p>We must speed the remarkable advances in medical science. The human
         genome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life. American
         scientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian
         cancer and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to
         reverse its effects, and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives
         of people with HIV and AIDS.</p>
      <p>Since I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National
         Institutes of Health has increased dramatically to $1.5 billion. With
         new resources, NIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine
         for an AIDS vaccine, working with other scientists, to finally end the
         threat of AIDS. Thank you. Remember that every year, every year we move
         up the discovery of an AIDS vaccine we'll save millions of lives around
         the world. We must reinforce our commitment to medical science.</p>
      <p>To prepare America for the 21st century we must build stronger families.
         Over the past four years the Family and Medical Leave Law has helped
         millions of Americans to take time off to be with their families.</p>
      <p>With new pressures on people and the way they work and live, I believe
         we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for
         teacher conferences and a child's medical checkup. We should pass flex
         time so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it
         in for time off to be with their families.</p>
      <p>We must continue--we must continue, step by step, to give more families
         access to affordable quality health care. Forty million Americans still
         lack health insurance. Ten million children still lack health insurance.
         Eighty percent of them have working parents who pay taxes. That is
         wrong.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">My--my balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of
            those children.</span> <span class="poverty"><span class="economy">Since nearly half of all children who lose their
               insurance do so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget
               will also ensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still
               afford to keep their health insurance. No child should be without a
               doctor just because a parent is without a job.</span></span></p>
      <p>My Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the trust
         fund to 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many
         families with loved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's, and, for the first
         time, it would fully pay for annual mammograms.</p>
      <p>Just as we ended drive-through deliveries of babies last year, we must
         now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from
         the hospital only hours after a mastectomy.</p>
      <p>I ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman
         can stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy. With us
         tonight is Dr. Kristen Zarfos, a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at
         this practice spurred a national movement and inspired this legislation.
         I'd like her to stand so we can thank her for her efforts. Dr. Zarfos,
         thank you.</p>
      <p>In the last four years, we have increased child support collections by
         50 percent. Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony
         for any parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this,
         his or her most sacred obligation.</p>
      <p>Finally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our
         determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that
         endanger their lives.</p>
      <p>To prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger
         communities. We should start with safe streets. Serious crime has
         dropped five years in a row. The key has been community policing. We
         must finish the job of putting 100,000 community police on the streets
         of the United States.</p>
      <p>We should pass the Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution, and I
         ask you to mount a full-scale assault on juvenile crime, with
         legislation that declares war on gangs with new prosecutors and tougher
         penalties, extends the Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be
         able to buy handguns, requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent
         unauthorized use, and helps to keep our schools open after hours, on
         weekends and in the summer so our young people will have someplace to go
         and something to say yes to.</p>
      <p>This balanced budget includes the largest anti-drug effort ever--to stop
         drugs at their source; punish those who push them; and teach our young
         people that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs will kill
         them. I hope you will support it.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural
            neighborhoods, but we must do more to empower them to create the
            conditions in which all families can flourish and to create jobs through
            investment by business and loans by banks.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We should double the number of empowerment zones. They've already
            brought so much hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment
            rate has been cut in half in four years. We should restore contaminated
            urban land and buildings to constructive use. We should expand the
            network of community development banks.</span></p>
      <p>And together, we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment
         approach, including private sector tax incentives, to renew our capital
         city so that Washington is a great place to work and live--and once
         again the proud face America shows the world!</p>
      <p>We must protect our environment in every community. In the last four
         years, we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous
         12. Now we should clean up 500 more so that our children grow up next to
         parks, not poison. I urge to pass my proposal to make big polluters live
         by a simple rule: If you pollute our environment, you should pay to
         clean it up.</p>
      <p>In the last four years, we strengthened our nation's safe food and clean
         drinking water laws; we protected some of America's rarest, most
         beautiful land in Utah's Red Rocks region; created three new national
         parks in the California desert; and began to restore the Florida
         Everglades.</p>
      <p>Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands.
         Tonight I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage
         Rivers to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts
         and clean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can
         grow the economy as we protect the environment.</p>
      <p>We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst
         toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our
         health even as they change our climate.</p>
      <p>Now, we all know that in all of our communities some of our children
         simply don't have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or
         schools or neighborhoods. And that means the rest of us must do more,
         for they are our children, too. That's why President Bush, General Colin
         Powell, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join the vice
         president and me to lead the President's Summit of Service in
         Philadelphia in April.</p>
      <p>Our national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000
         young people to work their way through college as they serve America.
         Now we intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of
         ways. Citizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans
         should embrace. And I ask your support for that endeavor.</p>
      <p>I'd like to make just one last point about our national community. <span class="economy">Our
            economy is measured in numbers and statistics.</span> And it's very important.
         But the enduring worth of our nation lies in our shared values and our
         soaring spirit. So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to
         support the arts and humanities I believe we should stand by them and
         challenge our artists, musicians, and writers, challenge our museums,
         libraries, and theaters.</p>
      <p>We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join
         with their fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration
         of the American spirit in every community, a celebration of our common
         culture in the century that is past and in the new one to come in a new
         millennium so that we can remain the world's beacon not only of liberty
         but of creativity long after the fireworks have faded.</p>
      <p>To prepare America for the 21st century we must master the forces of
         change in the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an
         uncharted time.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="diplomacy">Fifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the institutions
               that secured victory in the Cold War and built a growing world economy.</span></span>
         As a result, today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share
         our interests. <span class="diplomacy">Already we have dismantled many of the blocks and
            barriers that divided our parents' world. For the first time, more
            people live under democracy than dictatorship including every nation in
            our own hemisphere but one, and its day, too, will come.</span></p>
      <p>Now we stand at another moment of change and choice, and another time to
         be farsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and
         prosperity.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">In this endeavor, our first task is to help to build for the very first
            time an undivided, democratic Europe. When Europe is stable, prosperous,
            and at peace, America is more secure.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were
            once our adversaries can become our allies. At the special NATO summit
            this summer, that is what we will begin to do. We must strengthen NATO's
            Partnership for Peace with non-member allies. And we must build a stable
            partnership between NATO and a democratic Russia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">An expanded NATO is good for America, and a Europe in which all
            democracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to each
            other, but in terms of what they can do together for the good of
            all--that kind of Europe is good for America.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Second, America must look to the East no less than to the West.</span></p>
      <p>Our security demands it. <span class="war">Americans fought three wars in Asia in this
            century.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">Our prosperity requires it. More than 2 million American jobs depend
               upon trade with Asia. <span class="war">There, too, we are helping to shape an Asia
                  Pacific community of cooperation, not conflict.</span></span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Let our--let our progress there not mask the peril that remains.</span>
         <span class="diplomacy">Together with South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea
            and bridge the Cold War's last divide. And I call on Congress to fund
            our share of the agreement under which North Korea must continue to
            freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China for the sake of our
            interests and our ideals. An isolated China is not good for America. A
            China playing its proper role in the world is. I will go to China, and I
            have invited China's president to come here, not because we agree on
            everything, but because engaging China is the best way to work on our
            common challenges, like ending nuclear testing, <span class="civil-rights">and to deal frankly with
               our fundamental differences, like human rights.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The American people must prosper in the global economy. We've worked
            hard to tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs
            at home. I'm proud to say that today America is once again the most
            competitive nation and the No. 1 exporter in the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">Now we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin
               America, two of the fastest-growing regions on earth, or be left behind
               as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations. That is
               why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open
               markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">We need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy. After all,
               we have the best workers and the best products. In a truly open market,
               we can out-compete anyone, anywhere on earth.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">But this is about more than economics. By expanding trade, we can
               advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world. There is no
               better example of this truth than Latin America where democracy and open
               markets are on the march together. That is why I will visit there in the
               spring to reinforce our important ties.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">We should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our
               neighbor, Mexico, from its economic crisis. And we should all be proud
               that last month Mexico repaid the United States, three full years ahead
               of schedule, with half a billion dollar profit to us.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace. From the
            Middle East to Haiti, from Northern Ireland to Africa, taking reasonable
            risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts
            later. With American leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia. Now
            the habits of peace must take hold.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">The new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to
            accelerate. Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support of our
            troops. They are doing a remarkable job there for America, and America
            must do right by them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Fifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security.</span> <span class="diplomacy">In the
            past four years, we agreed to ban--we led the way to a worldwide
            agreement to ban nuclear testing.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">With Russia, we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals and we stopped
            targeting each other's citizens.</span> <span class="war">We are acting to prevent nuclear
            materials from falling into the wrong hands, and to rid the world of
            land mines.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">We are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug
               traffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully
               accountable if they do.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Now we must rise to a new test of leadership--ratifying the Chemical
               Weapons Convention. Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops
               safer from chemical attack. It will help us to fight terrorism. We have
               no more important obligations, especially in the wake of what we now
               know about the Gulf War.</span></span></p>
      <p>This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by
         Republican and Democratic administrations, and Republican and Democratic
         members of Congress, <span class="diplomacy">and already approved by 68 nations.</span> But if we do
         not act by April the 29th, when this convention goes into force--with or
         without us--we will lose the chance to have Americans leading and
         enforcing this effort. Together we must make the Chemical Weapons
         Convention law so that at last we can begin to outlaw poisoned gas from
         the earth.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Finally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges. We must
            maintain a strong and ready military. We must increase funding for
            weapons modernization by the year 2000. And we must take good care of
            our men and women in uniform. They are the world's finest.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">We must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy and pay our
               debts and dues to international financial institutions like the World
               Bank--and to a reforming United Nations. Every dollar--every dollar we
               devote to preventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the
               spread of disease and starvation brings a sure return in security and
               savings. Yet international affairs spending today is just 1 percent of
               the federal budget, a small fraction of what America invested in
               diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold
               war.</span></span></p>
      <p>If America is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America
         simply must find the will to pay our way. A farsighted America moved the
         world to a better place over these last 50 years. And so it can be for
         another 50 years. But a shortsighted America will soon find its words
         falling on deaf ears all around the world.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Almost exactly 50 years ago in the first winter of the Cold War
            President Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our
            country to meet its responsibilities of leadership. <span class="war">This was his
               warning. He said, "If we falter, we may endanger the peace of the world,
               and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation."</span></span></p>
      <p>That Congress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenburg,
         answered President Truman's call. Together, they made the commitments
         that strengthened our country for 50 years. Now let us do the same. Let
         us do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation, to keep America
         strong, secure and prosperous for another 50 years.</p>
      <p>In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of
         the power of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain
         strong as one America.</p>
      <p>All over the world people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic and
         religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the world's
         most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is
         possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences.
         America has always been a nation of immigrants.</p>
      <p>From the start, a steady stream of people in search of freedom and
         opportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home. We
         started as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans. We have grown
         into an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and
         promise.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, we must never, ever believe that our diversity is a
         weakness; it is our greatest strength.</p>
      <p>Americans speak every language, know every country. People on every
         continent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great
         potential, and they always will, as long as we strive to give all our
         citizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their own
         greatness.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We're not there yet. We still see evidence of a biting bigotry and
            intolerance in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and
            bombed buildings. We must fight against this in our country and in our
            hearts.</span></p>
      <p>Just a few days before my second inauguration, one of our country's
         best-known pastors, Reverend Robert Schuller, suggested that I read
         Isaiah 58:12. Here's what it says: "Thou shalt raise up the foundations
         of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the
         breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in."</p>
      <p>I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office, on behalf
         of all Americans, for no matter what our differences in our faiths, our
         backgrounds, our politics, we must all be repairers of the breach.</p>
      <p>I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how.
         Congressman Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose
         family came from Mexico. He was only 51 years old. He was awarded the
         Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart fighting for his
         country in Vietnam. And he went on to serve Texas and America fighting
         for our future here in this chamber.</p>
      <p>We are grateful for his service and honored that his mother, Lillie
         Tejeda, and his sister, Mary Alice, have come from Texas to be with us
         here tonight. And we welcome you. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Gary Locke, the newly-elected governor of Washington state, is the first
         Chinese-American governor in the history of our country. He's the proud
         son of two of the millions of Asian American immigrants who strengthened
         America with their hard work, family values and good citizenship.</p>
      <p>He represents the future we can all achieve. Thank you, governor, for
         being here. Please stand up.</p>
      <p>Reverend Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with
         Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsla, Sue Winski and Dr. Kristen
         Zarfos--they're all Americans from different roots whose lives reflect
         the best of what we can become when we are one America.</p>
      <p>We may not share a common past, but we surely do share a common future.
         Building one America is our most important mission, the foundation for
         many generations of every other strength we must build for this new
         century. Money cannot buy it, power cannot compel it, technology cannot
         create it. It can only come from the human spirit.</p>
      <p>America is far more than a place; it is an idea--the most powerful idea
         in the history of nations, and all of us in this chamber, we are now the
         bearers of that idea, leading a great people into a new world.</p>
      <p>A child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century.
         Everything that child will know about America will be because of what we
         do now to build a new century. We don't have a moment to waste.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000. One
         thousand days to prepare our people. One thousand days to work together.
         One thousand days to build a bridge to a land of new promise.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, we have work to do. Let us seize those days and the
         century.</p>
      <p>Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.

      <h3>January 27, 1998</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress,
         distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>Since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two
         patriots and fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of
         the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep
         love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives
         of all our people.</p>
      <p>In the past few weeks, they have both been eulogized. Tonight, I think
         we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends
         that we celebrate their lives, and give thanks for their service to our
         nation.</p>
      <p>For 209 years, it has been the president's duty to report to you on the
         state of the union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the
         American people, these are good times for America. <span class="economy">We have more than 14
            million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core
            inflation in 30 years, incomes are rising and we have the highest home
            ownership in history.</span> Crime has dropped for a record five years in a
         row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our
         leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of
         our union is strong.</p>
      <p>But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to
         rest. It is a time to build--to build the America within reach, an
         America where everybody has a chance to get ahead, with hard work; where
         every citizen can live in a safe community; where families are strong,
         schools are good, and all our young people can go on to college; an
         America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to
         Alzheimer's to AIDS; an America where every child can stretch a hand
         across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever
         painted, every symphony ever composed; where government provides
         opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back
         to their communities; an America which leads the world to new heights of
         peace and prosperity.</p>
      <p>This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can
         leave to our children--if we join together to finish the work at hand.
         Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so
         short a time.<span class="economy"> Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted
            beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global
            economy, a truly new world.</span></p>
      <p>For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as
         Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the
         very idea of America, widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the
         meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect union. We shaped a new
         kind of government for the information age. I thank the vice president
         for his leadership, and the Congress for its support, in building a
         government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and
         most of all, a government that gives the American people the tools they
         need to make the most of their own lives.</p>
      <p>We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government
         is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow
         Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in
         35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government but a
         stronger nation.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We are moving steadily toward a an even stronger America in the 21st
            century--an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in
            responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, Americans in this chamber and across this nation have pursued a
            new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and
            spur growth; investments in education and skills, in science and
            technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new
            economy; new markets for American products and American workers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357
            billion, and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be
            $10 billion, and heading lower.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the
            damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to
            announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensively large that
            it had 11 zeros, will be simply zero.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I will submit to Congress, for 1999, the first balanced budget in 30
            years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this
            year--four years ahead of schedule.</span></p>
      <p>You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into
         black is no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American
         people, and of two visionary actions in Congress: The courageous vote in
         1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly
         historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.</p>
      <p>Here's the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce
         balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk
            reopening the deficit. Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts
            so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax
            rates in 20 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments
            and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for
            education, for child care, for the environment.</span></p>
      <p>But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet
         this test: approve only those priorities that can actually be
         accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll
            then have a sizeable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What
            should we do with this projected surplus?</span></p>
      <p>I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's
         every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary
         measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Let us say--let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're
         70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social
         Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment:
         Social Security first. Let's do that--together.</p>
      <p>I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us
         tonight should be invited to join in this discussion, in facing these
         issues squarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed.
         We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the
         country, and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate.
         We'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December. And
         one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft
         historic bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our
         generation, a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to
            reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can
            afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers
            struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum
            wage.</span></p>
      <p>The information age is first and foremost an education age, in which
         education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last
         year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest
         priority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward, and urged all
         of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.</p>
      <p>Since then, this Congress--across party lines--and the American people
         have responded, in the most important year for education in a
         generation-- <span class="infra">expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000
            charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to
            the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a
            million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands
            of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our
            8-year-olds can read.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Last year I proposed--and you passed--220,000 new Pell Grant
            scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, already less
            expensive and easier to repay--now you get to deduct the interest.
            Families all over America now can put their savings into new, tax-free
            education IRAs.</span></p>
      <p>And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a
         $1500 tax credit--a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most
         community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate
         school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did
         that, and you should be very proud of it.</p>
      <p>And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family
         listening to us tonight: your children can go on to college. <span class="poverty">If you know
            a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up, she can go on to
            college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they
            won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give
            up, their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's
            caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes
            necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to
            give up, he can go on to college.</span></p>
      <p>Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as
         universal in the 21st century as high school is today. And, my friends,
         that will change the face and future of America.</p>
      <p>We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher
         education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools
         the world's best as well--by raising standards, raising expectations and
         raising accountability.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for
         the very first time, a voluntary national test based on national
         standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math.</p>
      <p>Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the
         basics. And every parent already knows the key; good teachers and small
         classes.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size
         in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire a hundred
         thousand new teachers who have passed the state competency tests. Now
         with these teachers--listen--with these teachers, we will actually be
         able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an
         average of 18 students a class all across America.</p>
      <p>Now, if I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes
         requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax
         cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.</p>
      <p>We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from
         grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any
         favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.</p>
      <p>Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision--not to hold our children
         back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion and started
         mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.</p>
      <p>I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to
         them stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the
         tools to make sure they do.</p>
      <p>I also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and
         universities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the
         sixth grade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they
         can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek
               opportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We
               must shape this global economy, not shrink from it.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">In the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with
               240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing
               the proud stamp, "Made in the USA." Today, record high exports account
               for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going,
               because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer,
               more stable world.</span></span></p>
      <p>Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a
         great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more
         comprehensive trade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe
         that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading
         partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will
         give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no
         favors, even if there's more business; and second, that if we have more
         trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards
            around the world. It should--I have made it abundantly clear that it
            should be a part of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other
            countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away
            from trade with them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to
            join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all-abusive
            child labor.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left
            behind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which
            may have nothing to do with trade. That's why we have more than doubled
            funding for training dislocated workers since 1993. And if my new budget
            is adopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more, and more
            quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty"><span class="economy">You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base
               closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
               Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate
               the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill
               for Workers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move
               quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.</span></span></p>
      <p>Now, we all know in every way in life change is not always easy, but we
         have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from
         it, or reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here: while we've
         been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating
         millions of new jobs. <span class="civil-rights"><span class="diplomacy">So this year we will forge new partnerships with
               Latin America, Asia and Europe, and we should pass the new African Trade
               Act. It has bipartisan support.</span></span></p>
      <p>I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority
         necessary to open more new markets, created more new jobs, which every
         president has had for two decades.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive,
            the world's economies are more and more interconnected and
            interdependent. <span class="diplomacy">Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies
               everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to
               Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.</span></span></p>
      <p>Now why should Americans be concerned about this?</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">First, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession,
            they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">Second, they're also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their
               value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our
               market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher
               for our people to compete.</span></span></p>
      <p>And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters
         our security.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="economy">The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it
               that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the
               world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small
               as possible is the right thing to do for America, and the right thing to
               do for a safer world.</span></span></p>
      <p>Our policy is clear: no nation can recover if it does not reform itself,
         but when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we
         should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's
         commitment to the International Monetary Fund.</p>
      <p>And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent
         here, that preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is
         far wiser than ignoring the thunder 'til the clouds are just overhead.</p>
      <p>A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in
         responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We
         could be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure,
         together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing
         welfare checks with paychecks.</p>
      <p>Last year, after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls I
         challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by
         the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal two full
         years ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage,
         persistence and hope.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off
            welfare. Today she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough
            money to move her family into a good neighborhood. And she's helping
            other welfare recipients go to work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare
            revolution. There are millions like her all across America, and I am
            happy she could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of
            you. Please stand up.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a
            success; providing child care, helping families move closer to available
            jobs, challenging more companies to join our Welfare to Work
            Partnership, increasing child-support collections from deadbeat parents
            who have a duty to support their own children. </span>I also want to thank
         Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here
         legally and working hard. And I hope you will finish that job this year.</p>
      <p>We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their
         most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that
         Americans can keep their health insurance when they changed jobs. Last
         year, we extended health care to up to 5 million children. This year, I
         challenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty
         million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans
         save money, and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be
         made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants.</p>
      <p>I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a
         consumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all
         your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to
         choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to
         emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it. You have the
         right to keep your medical records confidential.</p>
      <p>Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality
         care. Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost
         their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose
         their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work,
         they're left with nowhere to turn.</p>
      <p>So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the
         Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of
         mind it will provide will be priceless.</p>
      <p>Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest
         health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking spread by
         multimillion dollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress. Let's
         pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public
         health, protect our tobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco
         companies do business forever.</p>
      <p>Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price
         of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years, with
         penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children.</p>
      <p>Now tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and a
         thousand will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as
         the Congress that saved their lives.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a
            constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers, and
            their even more important obligations to be good parents.</span></p>
      <p>The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was
         privileged to sign into law as president in 1993. Since then, about 15
         million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them
         all across this country. I ask you to extend the law to cover 10 million
         more workers, and to give parents time off when they have to go see
         their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed
            at home and at work. Last year, I co-hosted the very first White House
            conference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America's
            first lady. From all corners of America, we heard the same
            message--without regard to region or income or political
            affiliation--we've got to raise the quality of child care, we've got to
            make it safer, we've got to make it more affordable.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million
            more children; scholarships and background checks for child-care
            workers, and a new emphasis on early learning; tax credits for
            businesses that provide child care for their employees; and a larger
            child-care tax credit for working families.</span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with
            an income of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a
            single penny of federal income tax.</span></p>
      <p>You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own
         personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a
         young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an
         education and come back and support me, if my grandparents hadn't been
         able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky.</p>
      <p>How many other families have never had that same opportunity? The truth
         is, we don't know the answer to that question, but we do know what the
         answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to
         choose between the job they need and the child they love.</p>
      <p>A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe
         schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police,
         tougher punishment, smarter prevention with crime-fighting partnerships,
         with local law enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the
         road.</p>
      <p>I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down,
         robbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down for five years in a
         row all across America. Now, we need to finish the job of putting
         100,000 more police on our streets.</p>
      <p>Again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more
         prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and
         drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you
         to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think
         every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between
         the hours of 3:00 in the afternoon and 8:00 at night. We can keep so
         many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them
         some place to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.</p>
      <p>Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his
         leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug
         budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a ground-breaking effort
         to hire a thousand new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most
         sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs
         at our borders.</p>
      <p>Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, good as they are, they
         can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large
         numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the chief
         justice of the United States wrote: "Judicial vacancies cannot remain at
         such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice."</p>
      <p>I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the
         highly qualified nominees before you, up or down.</p>
      <p>We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world.
         On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a
         new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it; today's
         possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees. America must stand against
         the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy
         access of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug
         traffickers.</p>
      <p>These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of
         information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal
         if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these
         challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for
         the 21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and
         isolating those who do not.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make
            Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. For
            50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure.
            Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy.
            I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">By taking in new members and working closely with new partners,
               including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a
               stronghold for peace in the 21st century.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and
               their mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to
               Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional
               delegation. We saw children playing in the streets where, two years ago,
               they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with
               food. The cafes were alive with conversation. The progress there is
               unmistakable; but it is not yet irreversible.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of
               American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I
               think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said: "This is like being
               ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game; now is not the time to
               walk off the field and forfeit the victory."</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very
               proud of what they are doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of
               them. One of those--one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the
               first lady tonight: Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a
               decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army.
               Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from
               taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance
               in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do
               their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and
               ready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century
               weapons they need to defeat any enemy.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the
            serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades
            after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a Comprehensive
            Nuclear Test Ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help
            to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons, and make
            it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them.</span></p>
      <p>I am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs
         of Staff--Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones, and
         Admiral William Crowe--have endorsed this treaty, and I ask the Senate
         to approve it this year.</p>
      <p>Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and
         biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized
         criminals seeking to acquire them.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his
               nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on
               developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to
               deliver them.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job,
               finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during
               the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from
               completing their mission.</span></span></p>
      <p>I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats,
         when I say to Saddam Hussein, "You cannot defy the will of the world,"
         and when I say to him, "You have used weapons of mass destruction
         before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again."</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Last year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to
            protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to
            prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological
            Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are
            good, but the enforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new
            international inspection system to detect and deter cheating. In the
            months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in
            Asia and Europe, and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan,
            from South America to China. And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle
            East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United
            Nations.</span></p>
      <p>More and more we are working with other nations to achieve common goals.
         If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we
         see--as we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also
         share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are
         actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with
         other nations. But we have to do our part.</p>
      <p>Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect
         union. To all of you, I say, it is a journey we can only make together,
         living as one community.</p>
      <p>First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of
         our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too
         expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race.</p>
      <p>This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote
         on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by senators McCain and
         Feingold. Let's be clear; a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for
         soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy
         and pass campaign finance reform this year.</p>
      <p>But at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for
         the explosion in campaign costs: the high cost of media advertising. I
         will-- for the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in
         the audience--I will formally request that the Federal Communications
         Commission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time--for
         candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a
         public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to
         strengthen our democracy.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have reduced the federal
         payroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated
         hundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every
         government agency. But we can do more.</p>
      <p>Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS.
         We need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger
         taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent
         taxpayers.</p>
      <p>Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of
         Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now
         languish in the Senate. Tonight, I ask the Senate: Follow the House;
         pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to
         goodness before I finish I can think of something to say 'Follow the
         Senate' on so I'll be out of trouble!</p>
      <p><span class="infra">A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For
            the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private
            enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development
            banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of
            polluted sites for development.</span></p>
      <p>Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to
         triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to
         invest in those areas. We should. We should also give poor families more
         help to move into homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur
         the construction of more low-income housing.</p>
      <p>Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of
         Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city
         for all who live and visit here.</p>
      <p>Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are
         still the gateway for new immigrants from every continent who come here
         to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going
         strong into the 21st Century. They're a very important part of our
         future.</p>
      <p>Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the
         water they drink, the Earth they will inherit. Last year we put in place
         the toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect
         Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's
         right to know about toxics that threaten their children.</p>
      <p>Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to
         protect consumers from dangers like e. coli and salmonella.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water initiative,
         a far-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal
         waters for our children.</p>
      <p>Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem
         of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires
         worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded
         unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases
         at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our
         children and grandchildren at risk.</p>
      <p>This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement
         committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market
         forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6
         billion in tax cuts, in research and development, to encourage
         innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient
         homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have
         told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the
         strongest in a generation, and our environment is the cleanest in a
         generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow
         the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming, we'll
         do it again.</p>
      <p>Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the
         ideal heard 'round the world: that we're all created equal. Throughout
         our history, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully
         lived up to it. Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter
         more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.</p>
      <p>What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America
         truly becomes one nation, what do we have to do? We're becoming more and
         more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The
         answer cannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our shared
         values.</p>
      <p>And we all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all
         want our children to grow up in the world where their talents are
         matched by their opportunities.</p>
      <p>I've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our
         common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us
         from becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still
         must overcome.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Discrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously
            enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the
            backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand
            of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should
            act now to end their wait.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward
            building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans,
            without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all
            Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs
            available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all
            parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one
            nation.</span></p>
      <p>We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address
         the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only
         move forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at
         home watching tonight, is also committed to this cause.</p>
      <p>We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On
         the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer
         out a common identity.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in
            AmeriCorps. Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together
            in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared
            values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and
            citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual
            respect. We are many. We must be one.</span></p>
      <p>In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we
         mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year,
         Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote
         America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and
         culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and
         every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as
         Americans. We should protect them.</p>
      <p>I am proposing a public-private partnership to advance our arts and
         humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures
         great and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.</p>
      <p>Now, think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles
         every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing
         cystic fibrosis; it took nine years. Last year, scientists located the
         gene that causes Parkinson's disease--in only nine days! Within a
         decade, gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses
         throughout a lifetime. Soon, we'll be able to carry all the phone calls
         on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A
         child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century.</p>
      <p>Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st Century
         research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding
         increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National
         Science Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute. We have already
         discovered we have already discovered genes for breast cancer and
         diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the
         generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a
         revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.</p>
      <p>As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see
         that science serves humanity, not the other way around. <span class="civil-rights">We must prevent
            the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American, and we
            must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious
            communities, and ban the cloning of human beings.</span></p>
      <p>We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of
         cyberspace. Think of this: the first time I made a State of the Union
         speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web--
         literally just a handful of people.</p>
      <p>Now in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and
         millions of Americans surf the Net every day.</p>
      <p>We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children
         from inappropriate material on the Net, but we also must make sure that
         we protect the exploding, global commercial potential of the Internet.
         We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our
         kids. For one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the
         next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know. And
         the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand
         times faster than today.</p>
      <p>Even as we explore this inner space, in the new millennium we're going
         to open new frontiers in outer space.</p>
      <p>Throughout all history, human kind has had only one place to call home:
         our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16
         countries will build a foothold in the heavens--the International Space
         Station. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually
         set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited
         potential.</p>
      <p>And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat
         missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will
         return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn!</p>
      <p>John, you will carry with you America's hopes, and on your uniform once
         again you will carry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection
         between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.</p>
      <p>Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright
         stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved Francis
         Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words
         that became our National Anthem. Today, that Star-Spangled Banner, along
         with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of
         Rights, are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's
         treasures. And we must also save them for the ages.</p>
      <p>I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures
         so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the
         images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America,
         an America that has continued to rise through every age against every
         challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have
         always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one
         nation, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our
         freedom, to form that more perfect union.</p>
      <p>Let that be our gift to the 21st century.</p>
      <p>God bless you, and God bless the United States.

      <h3>January 19, 1999</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my
         fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>Tonight I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union.</p>
      <p>Let me begin by saluting the new speaker of the House and thanking him
         especially tonight for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in
         the gallery with Mrs. Hastert. Lyn Gibson and Wei Ling Chestnut are the
         widows of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their
         lives to defend freedom's house.</p>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, at your swearing in you asked us all to work together in a
         spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly
         that.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Tonight, I stand before you to report that America has created the
            longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. With nearly 18
            million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation,
            the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare roles in 30
            years, and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a
            deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last
            year. And now, we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25
            years.</span></p>
      <p>Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest
         violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in
         a quarter century.</p>
      <p>America is a strong force for peace--from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to
         the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a government
         for the Information Age, once again a government that is a progressive
         instrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values of
         opportunity, responsibility and community, devoted to fiscal
         responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to
         make the most of their own lives in the 21st century, a 21st century
         government for 21st century America.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state
         of our union is strong. Now, America is working again. The promise of
         our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow
         the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a
         nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation
         today.</p>
      <p>So, with our budget surplus growing, <span class="economy">our economy expanding,</span> our
         confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our
         historic responsibility to the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a
         remarkable new challenge, the aging of America. With the number of
         elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a
         senior boom.</p>
      <p>So first and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st
         century.</p>
      <p>Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When President
         Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for
         eliminating what one woman called "the stark terror of penniless,
         helpless old age." Even today, without Social Security, half our
         nation's elderly would be forced into poverty.</p>
      <p>Today, Social Security is strong, but by 2013, payroll taxes will no
         longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. By 2032, the trust fund
         will be exhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full
         benefits older Americans have been promised.</p>
      <p>The best way to keep Social Security a rock solid guarantee is not to
         make drastic cuts in benefits; not to raise payroll tax rates; not to
         drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it. Instead,
         I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to
         save Social Security.</p>
      <p>Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus
         for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in
         the private sector just as any private or state government pension would
         do. This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55
         years.</p>
      <p>But we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing
         for the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who
         are nearly twice as likely to be poor as are other seniors. And we
         should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.</p>
      <p>Now, these changes will require difficult, but fully achievable choices
         over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a
         bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you
         tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both houses in both
         parties and ask that we join together in saying to the American people,
         we will save Social Security now.</p>
      <p>Now, last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what
         it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend
         any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved.
         First thing's first.</p>
      <p>Second, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our
         obligation to save and improve Medicare. Already we have extended the
         life of the Medicare trust fund by 10 years, but we should extend it for
         at least another decade. Tonight, I propose that we use one out of every
         six dollars in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the
         soundness of Medicare until the year 2020.</p>
      <p>But, again--but, again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work
         in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report
         of the Bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can
         secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing
         need of seniors--affordable prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>Third, we must help all Americans from their first day on the job to
         save, to invest, to create wealth.</p>
      <p>From its beginnings, Americans have supplemented Social Security with
         private pensions and savings. Yet today millions of people retire with
         little to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer
         than ever simply must save more than ever.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose
         a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century. I
         propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish
         universal savings accounts--USA accounts--to give all Americans the
         means to save.</p>
      <p>With these new accounts, Americans can invest as they choose and receive
         funds to match a portion of their savings with extra help for those
         least able to save. USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our
         nation's wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to
         support them.</p>
      <p>Fourth, we must invest in long-term care.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled and
            the families who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and
            bigger challenge with the aging of America--and we must do more to help
            our families deal with it.</span></p>
      <p>I was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that
         one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute
         determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on
         our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us the
            opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take
            it.</span></p>
      <p>Saving Social Security, Medicare, creating U.S. accounts, this is the
         right way to use the surplus. If we do so, if we do so, we will still
         have resources to meet critical needs and education and defense.</p>
      <p>And I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound. Listen to
         this, if we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and
         16 percent for Medicare over the next 15 years, that savings will
         achieve the lowest level of publicly-held debt since right before World
         War I in 1917.</p>
      <p>So with these four measures; saving Social Security, strengthening
         Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care, we
         can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish
         true security for 21st century seniors.</p>
      <p>Now, there are more children, from more diverse backgrounds, in our
         public schools that any time in our history. Their education must
         provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our
         entire nation to thrive in the new economy.</p>
      <p>Today we can say something we couldn't say six years ago. With tax
         credits and more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants
         and more Pell Grants, with education IRAs, the new HOPE Scholarship tax
         cut that more than five million Americans will receive this year, we
         have finally opened the doors of college to all Americans.</p>
      <p>With our support, nearly every state has set higher academic standards
         for public schools and a voluntary national test is being developed to
         measure the progress of our students. With over $1 billion in discounts
         available this year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting
         every classroom and library to the Internet.</p>
      <p>Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers
         to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the
         job.</p>
      <p>You know our children are doing better. SAT scores are up. Math scores
         have risen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem. While our
         fourth-graders out performed their peers in other countries in math and
         science, our eighth-graders are around average, and our 12th-graders
         rank near the bottom. We must do better.</p>
      <p>Now each year the national government invests more than $15 billion in
         our public schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that
         money to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work.</p>
      <p>First, later this year I will send to Congress a plan that for the first
         time holds states and school districts accountable for progress and
         rewards them for results. My Education Accountability Act will require
         every school district receiving federal help to take the following five
         steps:</p>
      <p>First, all schools must end social promotion.</p>
      <p>Now, no child, no child should graduate from high school with a diploma
         he or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to
         pass from grade to grade without mastering the material. But we can't
         just hold students back because the system fails them.</p>
      <p>So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and
         after-school programs to keep a million children learning. Now, if--if
         you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social
         promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master
         the basics. Math and reading scores are up three years running with some
         of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods. It will work,
         and we should do it.</p>
      <p>Second, all states and school districts must turn around their worst
         performing schools or shut them down. That's the policy established in
         North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt. North Carolina made the biggest
         gains in test scores in the nation last year. Our budget includes $200
         million to help states turn around their own failing schools.</p>
      <p>Third, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the
         quality of their teachers. The great majority of our teachers do a fine
         job, but in too many schools teachers don't have college majors or even
         minors in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be required to
         pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the subject their
         teaching.</p>
      <p>This year's balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher
         standards. And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest
         assignments, I recommend a six-fold increase in our program for college
         scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner-cities and
         isolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us bring excellence
         to every part of America.</p>
      <p>Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices.
         In too many communities it's easier to get information on the quality of
         the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools.</p>
      <p>Every school district should issue report cards on every school. And
         parents should be given more choices in selecting their public schools.</p>
      <p>When I became president, there was just one independent public charter
         school in all America. With our support on a bipartisan basis, today
         there are 1,100. My budget assures that early in the next century, there
         will be 3,000.</p>
      <p>Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning, and
         to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we
         should say that all states and school districts must both adopt and
         implement sensible discipline policies.</p>
      <p>Now let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many schools
         are so old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded students are
         learning in trailers. Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to
         change that. This year, with 53 million children in our schools,
         Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our
         communities build or modernize 5,000 schools.</p>
      <p>If we do these things--end social promotion, turn around failing
         schools, build modern ones, support qualified teachers, promote
         innovation, competition and discipline--then we will begin to meet our
         generation's historic responsibility to create to 21st century schools.</p>
      <p>Now, we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give
         their all every day at home and at work.</p>
      <p>The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise the
         minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by
            strengthening enforcement of the equal pay laws.</span></p>
      <p>That was encouraging, you know? There was more balance on the seesaw. I
         like that. Let's give them a hand. That's great.</p>
      <p>Working parents also need quality child care. So, again this year, I ask
         Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working
         families, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after-school
         program. And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay-at-home
         parents, too. They need support as well.</p>
      <p>Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children
         and their work. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first
         bill I signed into law, has now, since 1993, helped millions and
         millions of Americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative
         without risking their jobs. I think it's time, with all of the evidence
         that it has been so little burdensome to employers, to extend family
         leave to 10 million more Americans working for smaller companies, and I
         hope you will support it.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Finally, on the matter of work, parents should never have to face
            discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit
            companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they
            have children. That is not right.</span></p>
      <p>America's families deserve the world's best medical care. Thanks to
         bipartisan federal support for medical research, we are not on the verge
         of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to
         Alzheimer's to arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advances in
         medical science, we can't let our medical system lag behind.</p>
      <p>Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down
         costs, but threatening to drive down quality as well.</p>
      <p>I think we ought to say to every American, you should have the right to
         know all you medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need a
         specialist, you should have a right to see one. You have a right to the
         nearest emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things that
         we ought to say. And I think we ought to say you should have a right to
         keep your doctor during a period of treatment whether it's a pregnancy
         or a chemotherapy treatment or anything else. I believe this.</p>
      <p>Now I've ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans
         served by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health programs. But only
         Congress can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans.</p>
      <p>Last year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that
         opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to join
         together across party lines and pass a strong enforceable Patients' Bill
         of Rights.</p>
      <p>As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to
         all of our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority
         to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all
         say to the American people, we will protect the privacy of medical
         records this year.</p>
      <p>Now, two years ago, we acted to extend health coverage to up to five
         million children. Now we should go beyond that. We should make it easier
         for small businesses to offer health insurance. We should give people
         between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance
         to buy into Medicare.</p>
      <p>And we should continue to ensure access to family planning. No one
         should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And
         therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the
         landmark bipartisan legislation proposed by Sens. Kennedy and Jeffords,
         Roth and Moynihan, to allow people with disabilities to keep their
         health insurance when they go to work.</p>
      <p>We need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university
         health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of
         working families who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that
         today, but much more can be done. And my balanced budget makes a good
         down payment toward that goal. I hope you will think about them and
         support that provision.</p>
      <p>Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental
         illness. No American should ever be able--afraid ever to address this
         disease. This year we will host a White House Conference on Mental
         Health. With sensitivity, commitment and passion, Tipper Gore is leading
         our efforts here, and I'd like to thank her for what she's done. Thank
         you. Thank you.</p>
      <p>As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign
         to hook them on cigarettes. Now, I ask this Congress to resist the
         tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect our children
         from tobacco and to hold tobacco companies accountable, while protecting
         tobacco farmers.</p>
      <p>Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under
         Medicare and other programs. You know, the states have been right about
         this. Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema,
         and other smoking-related illnesses, the tobacco companies should.</p>
      <p>So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a
         litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and with the
         funds we recover to strengthen Medicare.</p>
      <p>Now, if we act in these areas--minimum wage, family leave, child care,
         health care, the safety of our children--then we will begin to meet our
         generation's historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for
         the 21st century.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in
            history, but we can do even better in building a 21st century economy
            that embraces all Americans.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Today's income gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the Congress
            passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the
            training they need. And I applaud all of you here who were part of that.</span></p>
      <p>This year, I recommend a five-year commitment to the new system, so that
         we can provide over the next five years appropriate training
         opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid
         response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when
         businesses close. I hope you will support this.</p>
      <p>Also, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for
         adult literacy to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the
         millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a
         fifth-grade level. We need to do this.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Here's some good news. In the past six years, we have cut the welfare
            rolls nearly in half.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a
            national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight our welfare-to-work
            partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of
            thousands of people, and our balanced budget will help another 200,000
            people move to the dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support
            it.</span></p>
      <p>We must bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of
         America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the
         Mississippi Delta, to our Native American communities, with more support
         for community development banks for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more
         vouchers for affordable housing.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise
            up to $15 billion in private sector capital, to bring jobs and
            opportunities and inner cities, rural areas, with tax credits, loan
            guarantees, including the new American Private Investment Companies,
            modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Companies.</span></p>
      <p>Now, for years and years we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private
         Investment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets
         overseas. But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas--they are
         right here at home. And we should go after them.</p>
      <p>We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm.</p>
      <p>As this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of
         foreign markets have devastated too many family farmers. Last year, the
         Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in
         American agriculture, and I am ready to work with lawmakers of both
         parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance
         reform and farm income assistance.</p>
      <p>I ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political
         issue. <span class="economy">Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in
            rural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">We must strengthen our lead in technology. It was government investment
            that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28-percent
            increase in long-term computing research.</span></p>
      <p>We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment by
         solving the so-called Y2K computer problem. We had one member of
         Congress stand up and applaud. And we may have about that ration out
         there applauding at home in front of their television sets. But
         remember, this is a big, big problem, and we've been working hard on it.
         Already we've made sure that the Social Security checks will come on
         time.</p>
      <p>But I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need
         every state and local government, every business large and small to work
         with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as
         the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You
            know, until recently a third of our economic growth came from exports.
            But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil has put that growth
            at risk. Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit
            especially hard. This is the most serious financial crisis in half a
            century.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To meet it, the U.S. and other nations have reduced interest rates and
            strengthened the International Monetary Fund and while the turmoil is
            not over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it</span>.</p>
      <p>At the same time, we will continue to work on the long-term project:
         building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes
         prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so
         much of Asia. This June, I will meet with other world leaders to advance
         this historic purpose and I ask all of you to support our endeavors. I
         also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for
         21st century America.</p>
      <p>You know, I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this
         chamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us and divided
         Americans outside this chamber for too long. Somehow, we have to find a
         common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and
         farmers and government can stand together. I believe these are the
         things we ought to all agree on. So, let me try.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">First, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade,
            but at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all
            countries actually benefit from trade; a trade that promotes the dignity
            of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must insist that international trade organizations be open to public
            scrutiny instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming
            more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the
            better part of this century doing here at home. We have got to put a
            human face on the global economy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Now, we must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our
            nation. I have already informed the government of Japan if that nation's
            sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America
            will respond.</span></p>
      <p>We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan
         guarantees, and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly
         $2 billion. I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade
         based on these principles. And I ask the Congress to join me again in
         this common approach and to give the president the trade authority long
         used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st
         century.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Tonight, I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United
            States in a new round of global trade negotiation to expand exports of
            services, manufactures and farm products</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Tonight, I say, we will work with the International Labor Organization
            on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world. And this
            year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to
            ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">If we do these things--invest in our people, our communities, our
            technology--and lead in the global economy, then we will begin to meet
            our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for
            America</span>.</p>
      <p>You know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the
         responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful, more
         secure, more free.</p>
      <p><span class="war">All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in
            Northern Ireland.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the
            path to peace. And with our NATO allies we are pressing the Serbian
            government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo--to bring those
            responsible to justice and to give the people of Kosovo the
            self-government they deserve.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting
            peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we
            watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call
            for the destruction of Israel.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now, I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can
            implement the Wye Agreement, to protect Israel's security, to stimulate
            the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not,
            we dare not, let them down. </span>I hope you will help me.</p>
      <p>As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's
         security, including increased danger from outlaw nations and terrorism.</p>
      <p>We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this
         summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The
         bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the
         risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world. So
         let's give them the support they need, the safest possible workplaces,
         and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead.</p>
      <p>We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We
         must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical
         emergencies, to support research into vaccines and treatments. We must
         increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and
         missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with
         Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear
         materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands. Our
         balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by
         almost two-thirds over the next five years.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">With Russia we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START
            II Treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III
            could cut them by 80 percent from their Cold War height.</span></p>
      <p>It's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If
         we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the
         Senate to take this vital step, approve the treaty now to make it harder
         for other nations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end
         nuclear testing for ever.</p>
      <p>For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its
         weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them.</p>
      <p>America will continue to contain [Iraqi President] Saddam [Hussein] and
         we will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its
         people.<span class="war"> Now, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were
            superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed, that we risk taking
            for granted the bravery and skill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro,
            a 10-year Air Force veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over
            Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine.</span> He is here with us tonight. I
         would like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of
         Operation Desert Fox.</p>
      <p><span class="war">It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in
            1985.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our
            military readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase
            over the next six years for readiness, for modernization, and for pay
            and benefits for our troops and their families.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">You know, we are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every
            community in America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders
            today still stand ready at a moments notice to go where comforts are few
            and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can.
            They always come through for America.</span> We must come through for them.</p>
      <p>The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security. The
         United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America
         might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U.N. I
         want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia--
            expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance
            with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China</span>.</p>
      <p>In China last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like
         to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense
         of liberty.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">But I'd also like to say again to the American people, it's important
            not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more
            the world will bring change and freedom to China.</span></p>
      <p>Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw
         democracy and reform rising, but still held back by violence and
         disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching radio
         democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy now
         beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the African Trade and
         Development Act.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean,
            our common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy
            and increase trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one is
            freely chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know
            the blessings of liberty</span>.</p>
      <p>The American people have opened their arms and their hearts and their
         arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so
         devastated by the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am
         committed to help them rebuild.</p>
      <p>When the first lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw
         thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers. In the
         Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had
         been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans working side by side. With her
         was some one else who has been very important to the relief efforts. You
         know sports records are made and sooner or later, they're broken. But
         making other people's lives better and showing our children the true
         meaning of brotherhood, that lasts forever. So for far more than
         baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in two countries tonight. Thank you.</p>
      <p>So I say to all of you, if we do these things, if we pursue peace, fight
         terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances, we will begin to
         meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st
         century America in a freer, more peaceful world.</p>
      <p>As the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make the
         safer, more livable, and more united. This year, we will reach our goal
         of 100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget.</p>
      <p>The Brady Bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives, and
         stalkers from buying handguns and now, the murder rate is the lowest in
         30 years, and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I propose a 21st Century Crime Bill to deploy the latest
         technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer. Our
         balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in
         the areas hardest hit by crime, and then to equip them with new tools
         from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots. We must break the
         deadly cycle of drugs and crime.</p>
      <p>Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to
         prisoners, "If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars." And to
         those on parole, "If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free
         of drugs."</p>
      <p>I ask Congress to restore the five-day waiting period for buying a
         handgun and extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles who commit
         violent crimes from buying a gun.</p>
      <p>We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our
         communities. Last year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by
         the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield.
         We were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns
         out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other
         parents don't have to live through their loss.</p>
      <p>After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came
         here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said "Please, please
         for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what
         happened in Jonesboro, happen in your town."</p>
      <p>It's a message she is passionately advocating every day. Suzann is here
         with us tonight, with the first lady. I would like to thank her for her
         courage and her commitment.</p>
      <p>In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I
         ask you to strengthen the Safe And Drug Free School Act, to pass
         legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to
         keep our children safe.</p>
      <p>Today, we're--excuse me--a century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt
         defined our great central task as leaving this land even a better land
         for our descendants than it is for us. Today, we're restoring the
         Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red rock canyons
         of Utah, protecting California's redwoods, and our precious coasts.</p>
      <p>But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming.
         Nineteen ninety-eight was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's
         heat waves, floods and storm are but a hint of what future generations
         may endure if we do not act now.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce
         greenhouse and other pollutions, and tax incentives and investment to
         spur clean energy technologies. And I want to work with members of
         Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary
         action to reduce greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>Now, all our communities face a preservation challenge as they grow, and
         green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are
         lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives. First, a
         $1 billion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease
         traffic congestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's
         quality of life. And second, a $1 billion lands legacy initiative to
         preserve places of natural beauty all across America, from the most
         remote wilderness to the nearest city park.</p>
      <p>These are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been
         developed without the visionary leadership of the vice president and I
         want to thank him very much for his commitment here. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something
         back. That's why we created AmeriCorps, our national service program
         that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and
         earn money for college.</p>
      <p>So far, in just four years, 100,000 young Americans have built
         low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped tutor children with
         churches, work with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters and
         performed countless other acts of service that has made America better.
         I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their
         lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.</p>
      <p>Now, we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st
         century. Last year, the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance
         reform legislation sponsored by Representatives [Christopher] Shays
         (R-Conn.) and [Martin T.] Meehan (D-Mass.) and Sens. [John] McCain
         (R-Ariz.) and [Russell] Feingold (D-Wis.). But a partisan minority in
         the Senate blocked reform. So I would like to say to the House, pass it
         again--quickly.</p>
      <p>And I'd like to say to the Senate, I hope you will say yes to a stronger
         American democracy in the year 2000.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Since 1997, our Initiative on Race has sought to bridge the divides
            between and among our people. In its report last fall, the Initiatives
            Advisory Board found that Americans really do want to bring our people
            together across racial lines.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We know it's been a long journey. For some it goes back to before the
            beginning of our republic. For others, back since the Civil War; for
            others, throughout the 21st century. But for most of us alive today, in
            a very real sense this journey began 43 years ago, when a woman named
            Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up.</span></p>
      <p>She's sitting down with the first lady tonight, and she may get up or
         not as she chooses.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the
            presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps.</span></p>
      <p>The initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them. <span class="civil-rights">But we
            know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either.
            Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or
            gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong and it ought to be
            illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the Employment
            Non-Discrimination Act and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of the
            land.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">You know, now since every person in America counts, every American ought
            to be counted. We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to
            do that.</span></p>
      <p>Our new immigrants must be part of our one America. After all, they're
         revitalizing our cities, they're energizing our culture, they're
         building up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome
         here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American
         life.</p>
      <p>That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of
         government. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are
         trying to do just that.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them
         meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it.</p>
      <p>Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships;
         whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles; whether they
         came yesterday or walked this land 1,000 years ago, our great challenge
         for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all
         the other challenges if we can go forward as one America.</p>
      <p>You know, barely more than 300 days from now we will cross that bridge
         into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the first lady has said,
         to honor the past and imagine the future.</p>
      <p>I'd like to take just a minute to honor her, for leading our Millennium
         Project, for all she's done for our children. For all she has done in
         her historic role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and
         abroad, I honor her.</p>
      <p>Last year--last year I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the
         millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary's traveled all across
         the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like
         Thomas Edison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home.</p>
      <p>Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And tonight,
         before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community
         to become a nationally recognized millennium community by launching
         projects that save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare
         our children for the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Already the response has been remarkable. And I want to say a special
         word of thanks to our private sector partners and to members in Congress
         of both parties for their support. Just one example. Because of you, the
         Star Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages.</p>
      <p>In ways large and small, as we look to the millennium, we are keeping
         alive what George Washington called the "sacred fire of liberty."</p>
      <p>Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our
         economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even
         wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across this nation,
         in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and
         uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America.</p>
      <p>I knew then we Americans could renew this country.</p>
      <p>Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address for the 20th
         century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and
         boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that "more
         perfect union" of our founders' dreams.</p>
      <p>We are now, at the end of a century, when generation after generation of
         Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming Depression, lifting
         up the dispossessed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice,
         building the largest middle class in history, winning two world wars and
         the "long twilight struggle" of the Cold War.</p>
      <p>We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievements of
         our forbearers in this century.</p>
      <p>Yet perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy,
         we don't see our own time for what it truly is--a new dawn for America.</p>
      <p>A hundred years from tonight, another American president will stand in
         this place and report on the State of the Union. He--or she--will look
         back on the 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make
         here and now.</p>
      <p>So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time,
         but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; that we put
         aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness;
         that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one
         nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look ahead to
         the next one--asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved
         country.</p>
      <p>Thank you, and good evening.

      <h3>January 27, 2000</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my
         fellow Americans:</p>
      <p>We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has
         our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with
         so little internal crisis or so few external threats. Never before have
         we had such a blessed opportunity--and, therefore, such a profound
         obligation-- to build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest
            economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in
            30 years; <span class="poverty">the lowest poverty rates in 20 years;</span> the lowest
            African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first
            back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth
            in our entire history.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have built a new economy</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American
            spirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen
            births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent. Welfare
            rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years</span>.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has ever
         been.</p>
      <p>As always, the credit belongs to the American people.</p>
      <p>My gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked
         with us to put progress above partisanship.</p>
      <p>Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be
         much to celebrate in the year 2000. <span class="economy">Then our nation was gripped by
            economic distress, social decline, political gridlock.</span> The title of a
         best-selling book asked: "America: What went wrong?"</p>
      <p>In the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things
         right. We restored the vital center, replacing outdated ideologies with
         a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all,
         responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.</p>
      <p>We reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas
         that stress both opportunity and responsibility, and give our people the
         tools to solve their own problems.</p>
      <p>With the smallest federal workforce in 40 years, we turned record
         deficits into record surpluses, and doubled our investment in education.
         We cut crime: with 100,000 community police and the Brady Law, which has
         kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals.</p>
      <p>We ended welfare as we knew it--requiring work while protecting health
         care and nutrition for children, and investing more in child care,
         transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We have
         helped parents to succeed at work and at home--with family leave, which
         20 million Americans have used to care for a newborn child or a sick
         loved one. We have engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service
         through AmeriCorps--while also helping them earn their way through
         college.</p>
      <p>In 1992, we had a roadmap. Today, we have results. More important,
         America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not
         let our renewed confidence grow into complacency. We will be judged by
         the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we
         will be held to a high standard, indeed. Because our chance to do good
         is so great.</p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st
         Century. Now, we must shape a 21st-Century American revolution--of
         opportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be, as we were in
         the beginning, a new nation.</p>
      <p>At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, "the one
         characteristic more essential than any other is foresight. . . It should
         be the growing nation with a future which takes the long look ahead."</p>
      <p>Tonight let us take our look long ahead--and set great goals for our
         nation.</p>
      <p>To 21st Century America, let us pledge that:</p>
      <p>Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to
         succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work--and
         no child will be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the
         aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable healthcare for all
         Americans. We will make America the safest big country on earth. We will
         bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course
         of climate change and leave a cleaner, safer planet. America will lead
         the world toward shared peace and prosperity, and the far frontiers of
         science and technology. And we will become at last what our founders
         pledged us to be so long ago--one nation, under God, indivisible, with
         liberty and justice for all.</p>
      <p>These are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them
         all this year. Not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us
         remember that the first American revolution was not won with a single
         shot. The continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our
         history--and the lesson of the last seven years--is that great goals are
         reached step by step: always building on our progress, always gaining
         ground.</p>
      <p>Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. For too long
         this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing
         national priorities. Let's begin with them.</p>
      <p>I ask you again to pass a real patient's bill of rights. Pass
         common-sense gun-safety legislation. Pass campaign finance reform. Vote
         on long overdue judicial nominations and other important appointees.
         And, again, I ask you to raise the minimum wage.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Two years ago, as we reached our first balanced budget, I asked that we
            meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal
            discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing
            something that would have seemed unimaginable seven years ago: We are
            actually paying down the national debt. If we stay on this path, we can
            pay down the debt entirely in 13 years and make America debt-free for
            the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835</span>.</p>
      <p>In 1993, we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit
         Reduction Act, winning passage in both houses by just one vote. Your
         former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort.
         He is here tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well.</p>
      <p>Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt
         reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make
         to every American--Social Security and Medicare. I ask you tonight to
         work with me to make a bipartisan down payment on Social Security reform
         by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social
         Security Trust Fund to ensure that it is strong and sound for the next
         50 years.</p>
      <p>But this is just the start of our journey. Now we must take the right
         steps toward reaching our great goals.</p>
      <p>Opportunity and Responsibility in Education</p>
      <p>First and foremost, we need a 21st Century revolution in education,
         guided by our faith that every child can learn. Because education is
         more than ever the key to our children's future, we must make sure all
         our children have that key. That means quality preschool and
         afterschool, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and college
         opportunities for all our children.</p>
      <p>For seven years, we have worked hard to improve our schools, with
         opportunity and responsibility: Investing more, but demanding more in
         return.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Reading, math, and college entrance scores are up. And some of the most
            impressive gains are in schools in poor neighborhoods.</span></p>
      <p>All successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher
         standards, more accountability, so all children can reach those
         standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It
         holds states and school districts accountable for progress, and rewards
         them for results. Each year, the national government invests more than
         $15 billion in our schools. It's time to support what works and stop
         supporting what doesn't.</p>
      <p>As we demand more than ever from our schools, we should invest more than
         ever in our schools.</p>
      <p>Let's double our investment to help states and districts turn around
         their worst-performing schools--or shut them down.</p>
      <p>Let's double our investment in afterschool and summer school programs--
         boosting achievement, and keeping children off the street and out of
         trouble. If we do, we can give every child in every failing school in
         America the chance to meet high standards.</p>
      <p>Since 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and
         improved its quality. Tonight, I ask for another $1 billion to Head
         Start, the largest increase in the program's history.</p>
      <p>We know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers.
         For two years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000
         new, qualified teachers, to lower class sizes in the early grades. This
         year, I ask you to make it three in a row.</p>
      <p>And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I
         propose a new teacher quality initiative--to recruit more talented
         people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and
         give all teachers the training they need.</p>
      <p>We know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became
         President, there was just one independent public charter school in all
         America. Today there are 1,700. I ask you to help us meet our goal of
         3,000 by next year.</p>
      <p>We know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet. We're
         getting there. In 1994, only three percent of our classrooms were
         connected. Today, with the help of the Vice President's E-rate program,
         more than half of them are; and 90 percent of our schools have at least
         one connection to the Internet.</p>
      <p>But we can't finish the job when a third of all schools are in serious
         disrepair, many with walls and wires too old for the Internet. Tonight,
         <span class="infra">I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate, urgent repairs.
            And again, to help build or modernize 6,000 schools, to get students out
            of trailers and into high-tech classrooms.</span></p>
      <p>We should double our bipartisan GEAR UP program to mentor 1.4 million
         disadvantaged young people for college. And let's offer these students a
         chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use
         to boost their test scores.</p>
      <p>To make the American Dream achievable for all, we must make college
         affordable for all. For seven years, on a bipartisan basis, we have
         taken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more-affordable
         student loans, education IRAs, and our HOPE scholarships, which have
         already benefited 5 million young people. 67 percent of high school
         graduates now go on to college, up almost 10 percent since 1993. Yet
         millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need
         help.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I propose a landmark $30-billion college opportunity tax cut--a
            middle-class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs.
            We've already made two years of college affordable for all. Now let's
            make four years of college affordable for all.</span></p>
      <p>If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward making sure
         every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed.</p>
      <p>Rewarding Work and Strengthening Families</p>
      <p>We need a 21st Century revolution to reward work and strengthen
         families-- by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at
         the most important work of all--raising their children. That means
         making sure that every family has health care and the support to care
         for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that
         no child grows up in poverty.</p>
      <p>From my first days as President, we have worked to give families better
         access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children's Health
         Insurance Program--CHIP--so that workers who don't have health care
         coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children.
         So far, we've enrolled 2 million children, and we're well on our way to
         our goal of 5 million.</p>
      <p>But there are still more than 40 million Americans without health
         insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we
         follow Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low income parents
         eligible for the insurance that covers their kids. Together with our
         children's initiative, we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured
         in America.</p>
      <p>Again, I ask you to let people between 55 and 65--the fastest growing
         group of uninsured--buy into Medicare. And let's give them a tax credit
         to make that choice an affordable one.</p>
      <p>When the Baby Boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for
         twice as many of our citizens--and yet it is far from ready to do so. My
         generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our
         burden. We must strengthen and modernize Medicare now.</p>
      <p>My budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it
         more efficient and competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of
         our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025; and, at long
         last, to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for
         prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one
         creating a Medicare program today would even consider excluding coverage
         for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors now lack
         dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives.
         Millions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the
         highest prices for them.</p>
      <p>In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to
         all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>Record numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones
         at home. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care.
         Frankly, that wasn't enough. This year, let's triple it to $3,000--and
         this year, let's pass it.</p>
      <p>And we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health
         care. I want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down
         the barriers to the decent treatment of mental illness: Tipper Gore.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in
         health care in the 35 years since the creation of Medicare--a big step
         toward assuring health care for all Americans, young and old.</p>
      <p>We must also make investments that reward work and support families.
         Nothing does that better than the Earned Income Tax Credit, the EITC.
         The "E" in "EITC" is about earning; working; taking responsibility and
         being rewarded for it. In my first Address to you, I asked Congress to
         greatly expand this tax credit; and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone,
         the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of
         poverty and toward the middle class--double the number in 1993.</p>
      <p>Tonight, I propose another major expansion. We should reduce the
         marriage penalty for the EITC, making sure it rewards marriage just as
         it rewards work. And we should expand the tax credit for families with
         more than two children to provide up to $1,100 more in tax relief.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for
            equal work. The female unemployment rate is the lowest in 46 years. Yet
            women still earn only about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must
            do better by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws,
            training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the
            Paycheck Fairness Act.</span></p>
      <p>Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, far away from many low-income
         families. In the past two years, I have proposed and Congress has
         approved 110,000 new housing vouchers--rent subsidies to help working
         families live closer to the workplace. This year, let us more than
         double that number. If we want people to go to work, they have to be
         able to get to work.</p>
      <p>Many working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child
         care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about two
         million children. My child care initiative, along with funds already
         secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more
         affordable for another 400,000 children.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">For hard-pressed middle-income families, we should also expand the child
            care tax credit. And we should take the next big step.<span class="poverty">We should make
               that tax credit refundable for low-income families. For those making
               under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child-care costs.
               We all say we're pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would
               prove it.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Tens of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as
            they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can
            make use of IRAs and 401-K retirement plans. We should do more to help
            working families save and accumulate wealth</span>. That's the idea behind
         so-called Individual Development Accounts. Let's take that idea to a new
         level, with Retirement Savings Accounts that enable every low- and
         moderate-income family in America to save for retirement, a first home,
         a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their
         contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save.
         And to give a major new tax credit for any small business that provides
         a meaningful pension to its workers.</p>
      <p>Nearly one in three American children grows up in a home without a
         father.<span class="poverty"> These children are five times more likely to live in poverty
            than children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and
            supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all children
            out of poverty</span>.</p>
      <p>We have doubled child support collections since 1992, and I am proposing
         tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. But we should
         recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children--and
         need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, got that help.
         Now he has a good job and he supports his son Ricardo. My budget will
         help 40,000 fathers make the choices Carlos did. And I thank him for
         being here.</p>
      <p>If there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is in
         our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Thanks to
         overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved
         foster care, supported those who leave it when they turn eighteen, and
         dramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive
         homes. I thank you for that. Of course, I am especially grateful to the
         person who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked
         tirelessly for children and families for thirty years now: my wife,
         Hillary.</p>
      <p>If we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward empowering
         parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is
         raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care,
         education and support for working families--and still offer tax cuts to
         help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents and
         reduce the marriage penalty--without forsaking the path of fiscal
         discipline that got us here. Indeed, we must make these investments and
         tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and
         extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the
         national debt.</p>
      <p>Responsibility and Crime</p>
      <p>Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years--the longest
         decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on
         community police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention.
         But nobody believes America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal:
         let's make America the safest big country in the world.</p>
      <p>Last fall, Congress supported my plan to hire--in addition to the
         100,000 community police we have already funded--50,000 more,
         concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support.</p>
      <p>Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered common-sense gun
         safety legislation to require Brady background checks at gun shows,
         child safety locks for all new handguns, and a ban on the importation of
         large-capacity ammunition clips. With courage--and a tie-breaking vote
         by the Vice President--the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for
         the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed
         to follow suit.</p>
      <p>We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel
         Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He
         was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents
         who lose their children, his father Tom has borne unimaginable grief.
         Somehow Tom has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his
         grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from
         his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage
         and wisdom will move this Congress to make common-sense gun safety
         legislation the very next order of business. Tom, thank you for being
         here tonight.</p>
      <p>We must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the
         books. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took
         office. But again, we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and
         local gun prosecutors, and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun
         traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give law enforcement the
         tools to trace every gun--and every bullet--used in a crime in America.</p>
      <p>Listen to this: the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in
         the United States is nine times higher than in the other 25
         industrialized nations--combined. Technologies now exist that could lead
         to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask
         Congress to fund research in Smart Gun technology. I also call on
         responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns
         and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and keep our
         children safe.</p>
      <p>Every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on
         their children. I thank the entertainment industry for accepting my
         challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet
         games. But the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be
         really useful to parents. Therefore, I now ask the industry to accept
         the First Lady's challenge--to develop a single, voluntary rating system
         for all children's entertainment, one that is easier for parents to
         understand and enforce.</p>
      <p>If we take all these steps, we will be well on our way to making America
         the safest big country in the world.</p>
      <p>Opening New Markets</p>
      <p>To keep our historic economic expansion going, we need a 21st Century
         revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, and hire new
         workers right here in America--in our inner cities, poor rural areas,
         and on Indian reservations.</p>
      <p>Our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. Over the last
         six months, I have traveled to many of them--joined by many of you, and
         many far-sighted business people--to shine a spotlight on the enormous
         potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from
         Watts to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Everywhere I've gone, I've
         met talented people eager for opportunity, and able to work. Let's put
         them to work.</p>
      <p>For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right
         thing to do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to
         it?</p>
      <p>I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in
         America's new markets that they now have to invest in foreign markets.
         <span class="economy">Tonight, I propose a large New Markets Tax Credit and other incentives
            to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital--to create new businesses
            and new investments in inner cities and rural areas.</span></p>
      <p>Empowerment Zones have been creating these opportunities for five years
         now. We should also increase incentives to invest in them and create
         more of them.</p>
      <p>This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is an American issue.
         Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined me
         and the Reverend Jesse Jackson in your home state of Illinois, and
         committed to working toward our common goal, by combining the best ideas
         from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working
         with you.</p>
      <p>We must maintain our commitment to community development banks and keep
         the community reinvestment act strong so all Americans have access to
         the capital they need to buy homes and build businesses.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">We need to make special efforts to address the areas with the highest
            rates of poverty</span>. <span class="economy">My budget includes a special $110 million initiative
            to promote economic development in the Mississippi Delta; and $1 billion
            to increase economic opportunity, health care, education and law
            enforcement for Native American communities.</span> In this new century, we
         should honor our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans.
         I thank leaders and members from both parties who have already expressed
         an interest in working with us on these efforts.</p>
      <p>There's another part of our American community in trouble today--our
         family farmers. When I signed the Farm Bill in 1996, I said there was a
         great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well,
         droughts, floods, and historically low prices have made times very bad
         for our farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety
         net, invest in land conservation, and create new markets by expanding
         our program for bio-based fuels and products.</p>
      <p>Today, opportunity for all requires something new: having access to a
         computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital
         divide between those who have these tools and those who don't.</p>
      <p>Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's
         just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to
         teach 21st Century skills and creates technology centers in 1,000
         communities to serve adults. This spring, I will invite high-tech
         leaders to join me on another New Markets tour--to close the digital
         divide and open opportunity for all our people. I thank the high-tech
         companies that are already doing so much in this area--and I hope the
         new tax incentives I have proposed will encourage others to join us.</p>
      <p>If we take these steps, we will go a long way toward our goal of
         bringing opportunity to every community.</p>
      <p>Global Change and American Leadership</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To realize the full possibilities of the new economy,</span> we must reach
         beyond our own borders, to shape the revolution that is tearing down
         barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals,
         economies and cultures: globalization.</p>
      <p>It is the central reality of our time. Change this profound is both
         liberating and threatening. But there is no turning back. And our open,
         creative society stands to benefit more than any other--if we
         understand, and act on, the new realities of interdependence. We must be
         at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and
         partner. We cannot build our future without helping others to build
         theirs.</p>
      <p>First, we must forge a new consensus on trade. Those of us who believe
         passionately in the power of open trade must ensure that it lifts both
         our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child
         labor or a race to the bottom on the environment and worker protection.
         Still, open markets and rules-based trade are the best engines we know
         for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental
         destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas. There is only one
         direction for America on trade: we must go forward.</p>
      <p>And we must make developing economies our partners in prosperity--which
         is why I ask Congress to finalize our groundbreaking African and
         Caribbean Basin trade initiatives.</p>
      <p>Globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring
         the world together around democracy, freedom, and peace, and to oppose
         those who would tear it apart.</p>
      <p>Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape
         the 21st Century world.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">First, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and
            China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are
            being held back from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy
            of communism, economic turmoil, <span class="war">a cruel and self-defeating war in
               Chechnya;</span> China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense
            of freedom. But think how much has changed in the past decade: thousands
            of former Soviet nuclear weapons eliminated; Russian soldiers serving
            with ours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the
            first time in a thousand years. And in China, an economy more open to
            the world than ever before. No one can know for sure what direction
            these great countries will choose. But we must do everything in our
            power to increase the chance they will choose wisely, to be constructive
            members of the global community.</span></p>
      <p>That is why we must support those Russians struggling for a democratic,
         prosperous future; <span class="war">continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and
            help Russia safeguard weapons and materials that remain.</span></p>
      <p>That is why Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring
         China into the WTO, by passing Permanent Normal Trade Relations as soon
         as possible this year. Our markets are already open to China. This
         agreement will open China's markets to us. And it will advance the cause
         of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China.</p>
      <p><span class="war">A second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that pose
            the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. America cannot
            prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests
            are at stake and we can make a difference, we must be peacemakers.</span></p>
      <p>We should be proud of America's role in bringing the Middle East closer
         than ever to a comprehensive peace; building peace in Northern Ireland;
         working for peace in East Timor and Africa; promoting reconciliation
         between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus; working to defuse crises
         between India and Pakistan;<span class="civil-rights">defending human rights and religious
            freedom.</span></p>
      <p>And we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and
         those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo--enabling
         a million innocent people to return to their homes.</p>
      <p><span class="war">When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John
            Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when
            another American plane went down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of
            enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our armed
            forces' skill and bravery, we prevailed without losing a single American
            in combat. Captain Cherrey, we honor you, and promise to finish the job
            you began</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">A third challenge is to keep the inexorable march of technology from
            giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine
            our defenses. The same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in
            the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal
            and easier to use</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We must meet this threat: by making effective agreements to restrain
            nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal
            technology to Iran; preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors;
            increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack;
            protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals; and
            developing a system to defend against new missile threats--while working
            to preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.</span></p>
      <p>I hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to build
         a consensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the
         Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A fourth challenge is to ensure that the stability of our planet is not
            <span class="poverty">threatened by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a
               world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new
               economy, while the rest live on the bare edge of survival.</span> We must do
            our part, with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of
            freedom.</span></p>
      <p>From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people won the right to choose their
         leaders in 1999 than in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. We must
         stand by democracies--like Colombia, fighting narco-traffickers for its
         people's lives, and our children's lives. I have proposed a strong
         two-year package to help Colombia win this fight; and I ask for your
         support. And I will propose tough new legislation to go after what drug
         barons value most-- their money.</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">In a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we
            must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the
            poorest countries so they can invest in education, health and economic
            growth--as the Pope and other religious leaders have urged. Last year,
            Congress made a down payment on America's share. And I ask for your
            continued support</span>.</p>
      <p>And America must help more nations break the bonds of disease. Last year
         in Africa, AIDS killed ten times as many people as war did. <span class="economy">My budget
            invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious
            killers. Today, I propose a tax credit to speed the development of
            vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB and AIDS.</span> I ask the private
         sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this
         cause. Together, we can save millions of lives.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our final challenge is the most important: to pass a national security
            budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the
            world, with heightened readiness and 21st Century weapons; raises
            salaries for our service men and women; protects our veterans;<span class="diplomacy"> fully
               funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war;</span> and makes good
            on our commitment to pay our UN dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this
            budget and I thank you for the extraordinary support you have
            given--Republicans and Democrats alike--to our men and women in uniform.
            I especially want to thank Secretary Cohen for symbolizing our
            bipartisan commitment to our national security--and Janet Cohen, I thank
            you for tirelessly traveling the world to show our support for the
            troops.</span></p>
      <p>If we meet all these challenges, America can lead the world toward peace
         and freedom in an era of globalization.</p>
      <p>Responsibility, Opportunity, and the Environment</p>
      <p>I am grateful for the opportunities the Vice President and I have had to
         work hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the
         notion that you can't expand the economy while protecting the
         environment. As our economy has grown, we have rid more than 500
         neighborhoods of toxic waste and ensured cleaner air and water for
         millions of families. In the past three months alone, we have acted to
         preserve more than 40 million acres of roadless lands in our National
         Forests and created three new National Monuments.</p>
      <p>But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must grow as
         well. Tonight, I propose creating a permanent conservation fund to
         restore wildlife, protect coastlines, and save natural treasures from
         California redwoods to the Everglades. This Lands Legacy endowment
         represents by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever
         proposed.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Vice President launched a new effort to help make
         communities more livable--so children will grow up next to parks, not
         parking lots, and parents can be home with their children instead of
         stuck in traffic. Tonight, we propose new funding for advanced transit
         systems-- for saving precious open spaces--for helping major cities
         around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality
         of life.</p>
      <p>The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global
         warming. Scientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade of
         the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse
         gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal
         areas will be flooded, economies disrupted.</p>
      <p>Many people in the United States and around the world still believe we
         can't cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth. In
         the Industrial Age that may have been true. In the digital economy, it
         isn't. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and
         provide even more growth. For example, just last week, automakers
         unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon--the fruits of a unique
         research partnership between government and industry. Before you know
         it, efficient production of biofuels will give us the equivalent of
         hundreds of miles from a gallon of gas.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To speed innovations in environmental technologies, I propose giving
            major tax incentives to businesses for the production of clean
            energy--and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances
            and the next generation of super-efficient cars when they hit the
            showroom floor. </span>I also call on the auto industry to use available
         technologies to make all new cars more fuel efficient right away. And on
         Congress to make more of our clean-energy technologies available to the
         developing world--creating cleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home.</p>
      <p>The Opportunity and Responsibility of Science and Technology</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the new century, innovations in science and technology will be the
            key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous
            improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy.</span></p>
      <p>Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire
         human genome--the very blueprint of life. It is important for all
         Americans to recognize that your tax dollars have fueled this research--
         and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a
         revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease.</p>
      <p>For example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's
         Disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer--and they are designing
         precision therapies that will block the harmful effects of these faulty
         genes for good. Researchers are already using this new technique to
         target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able
         to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. Scientists are
         also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see
         and microchips that would directly stimulate damaged spinal cords and
         allow people who are now paralyzed to stand up and walk.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Science and engineering innovations are also propelling our remarkable
            prosperity. <span class="economy">Information technology alone now accounts for a third of our
               economic growth, with jobs that pay almost 80 percent above the private
               sector average.</span> Again, we should keep in mind: government-funded
            research brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications
            satellites into being. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can
            translate foreign languages as fast as you can speak; materials 10 times
            stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight; and molecular computers
            the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fastest supercomputers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">To accelerate the march of discovery across all disciplines of science
            and technology, my budget includes an unprecedented $3 billion increase
            in the 21st Century Research Fund, the largest increase in civilian
            research in a generation.</span></p>
      <p>These new breakthroughs must be used in ways that reflect our most
         cherished values. First and foremost, we must safeguard our citizens'
         privacy. Last year, we proposed rules to protect every citizen's medical
         records. This year, we will finalize those rules. We have also taken the
         first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card statements
         and other financial records. Soon I will send legislation to the
         Congress to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic
         discrimination by employers or insurers.</p>
      <p>These steps will allow America to lead toward the far frontiers of
         science and technology--enhancing our health, environment, and economy
         in ways we cannot even imagine today.</p>
      <p>Community</p>
      <p>At a time when science, technology and the forces of globalization are
         bringing so many changes into our lives, it is more important than ever
         that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and
         in our national communities.</p>
      <p>No tie binds different people together like citizen service. There is a
         new spirit of service in America--a movement we have supported with
         AmeriCorps, an expanded Peace Corps, and unprecedented new partnerships
         with businesses, foundations, and community groups. Partnerships to
         enlist 12,000 companies in moving 650,000 of our fellow citizens from
         welfare to work. To battle drug abuse and AIDS. To teach young people to
         read. To Save America's Treasures. To strengthen the arts. To fight teen
         pregnancy. To prevent youth violence. To promote racial healing.</p>
      <p>We can do even more to help Americans help each other. <span class="poverty">We should help
            faith-based organizations do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and
            help young people get back on the right track with initiatives like
            Second Chance Homes to help unwed teen mothers.</span> We should support
         Americans who tithe and contribute to charities, but don't earn enough
         to claim a tax deduction for it. <span class="economy">Tonight, I propose new tax incentives
            to allow low- and middle-income citizens to get that deduction.</span></p>
      <p>We should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the
         American community--investing more to teach them civics and English. And
         since everyone in our community counts, we must make sure everyone is
         counted in this year's census.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Within ten years there will be no majority race in our largest state,
            California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority
            race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be
            our greatest strength. Just look around this chamber. We have members
            from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And
            America is stronger for it. But as we have seen, these differences all
            too often spark hatred and division, even here at home.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">We have seen a man dragged to death in Texas simply because he was
            black. A young man murdered in Wyoming simply because he was gay. In the
            last year alone, we've seen the shootings of African Americans, Asian
            Americans, and Jewish children simply because of who they were. This is
            not the American way. We must draw the line. Without delay, we must pass
            the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the Employment Non-Discrimination
            Act. And we should reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">No American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home,
            getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Tonight, I propose
            the largest ever investment to enforce America's civil rights laws.
            Protections in law must be protections in fact</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Last February, I created the White House Office of One America to
            promote racial reconciliation. That's what Hank Aaron, has done all his
            life. From his days as baseball's all-time homerun king to his recent
            acts of healing, he has always brought Americans together. We're pleased
            he's with us tonight.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">This fall, at the White House, one of America's leading scientists said
            something we should all remember. He said all human beings, genetically,
            are 99.9 percent the same. So modern science affirms what ancient faith
            has always taught: the most important fact of life is our common
            humanity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Therefore, we must do more than tolerate diversity--we must honor it and
            celebrate it.</span></p>
      <p>My fellow Americans, each time I prepare for the State of the Union, I
         approach it with great hope and expectations for our nation. But tonight
         is special--because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium.
         Behind us we see the great expanse of American achievement; before us,
         even grander frontiers of possibility.</p>
      <p>We should be filled with gratitude and humility for our prosperity and
         progress; with awe and joy at what lies ahead; and with absolute
         determination to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>When the framers finished crafting our Constitution, Benjamin Franklin
         stood in Independence Hall and reflected on a painting of the sun, low
         on the horizon. He said, "I have often wondered whether that sun was
         rising or setting. Today," Franklin said, "I have the happiness to know
         it is a rising sun." Well, today, because each generation of Americans
         has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers
         of possibility, we still bask in the warmth of Mr. Franklin's rising
         sun.</p>
      <p>After 224 years, the American Revolution continues. We remain a new
         nation. As long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be
         forever young. That is our destiny. And this is our moment.</p>
      <p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

      <h3>February 27, 2001</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress:  It's a great
         privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for
         governing our great country.  I thank you for your invitation to speak
         here tonight.  I know Congress had to formally invite me, and it could
         have been a close vote.  (Laughter.)  So, Mr. Vice President, I
         appreciate you being here to break the tie.  (Laughter.)</p>
      <p>I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come
         to the White House to discuss important issues.  We're off to a good
         start.  I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input.  You
         have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new President
         feel welcome.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath on the steps
         of this building.  I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws.
         (Applause.)  And I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility
         and respect in Washington.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I hope America is noticing the difference, because we're making
         progress.  Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation's Capital.
         And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because, in the
         end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will
         be judged by what we're able to accomplish.</p>
      <p>America today is a nation with great challenges, but greater resources.
         An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different
         pictures of our country.  <span class="economy">One would have warning signs: increasing
            layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools,<span class="poverty"> persistent
               poverty, <span class="civil-rights">the stubborn vestiges of racism.</span></span></span>  Another picture would be full
         of blessings:  a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is
         second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that
         is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength -- concerned
         citizens who care for our country and care for each other.</p>
      <p>Neither picture is complete in and of itself.  And tonight I challenge
         and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture
         to repaint the other; to direct the advantages of our time to solve the
         problems of our people.  Some of these resources will come from
         government.  Some, but not all.</p>
      <p>Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an
         old, tired argument:  on one side, those who want more government,
         regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government,
         regardless of the need.  We should leave those arguments to the last
         century, and chart a different course.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Government has a role, and an important role.  Yet, too much government
         crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private
         economy.  Our new governing vision says government should be active, but
         limited; engaged, but not overbearing.  And my budget is based on that
         philosophy.</p>
      <p>It is reasonable, and it is responsible.  It meets our obligations, and
         funds our growing needs.  <span class="economy">We increase spending next year for Social
            Security and Medicare, and other entitlement programs, by $81 billion.
            We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a very
            responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation.  My plan pays down
            an unprecedented amount of our national debt.  And then, when money is
            still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the
            first place.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>
         <span class="economy">A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives.
            Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner
            environment, a stronger defense -- these are all important needs, and we
            fund them.  The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to
            our children's education</span>  (Applause.)  Education is not my top priority
         -- education is my top priority and, by supporting this budget, you'll
         make it yours, as well.</p>
      <p>Reading is the foundation of all learning. <span class="economy"> So during the next five
            years, we triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in
            America learn to read. </span> Values are important, so we've tripled funding
         for character education to teach our children not only reading and
         writing, but right from wrong.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We've increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a
         good education starts with a good teacher.  And I have a wonderful
         partner in this effort.  I like teachers so much, I married one.
         (Applause.)  Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the
         profession that will shape our future -- teaching.  She will travel
         across America to promote sound teaching practices and early reading
         skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start.</p>
      <p>When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the
         difference.  Funding is important, and so is reform.  So we must tie
         funding to higher standards and accountability for results.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I believe in local control of schools.  We should not, and we will not,
         run public schools from Washington, D.C.  (Applause.)  Yet when the
         federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results.
         Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year
         between grades three and eight.  Measuring is the only way to know
         whether all our children are learning.  And I want to know, because I
         refuse to leave any child behind in America.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning.  They talk about
         teaching to the test.  But let's put that logic to the test.  If you
         test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you're teaching to
         the test, you're teaching math and reading.  And that's the whole idea.
         (Applause.)  As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility
         to meet them.  So we must streamline the dozens of federal education
         programs into five, and let states spend money in those categories as
         they see fit. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve and the support to
         do so.  Yet, if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give
         parents and students different options -- a better public school, a
         private school, tutoring or a charter school.  (Applause.)  In the end,
         every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice because,
         when it comes to our children, failure is simply not an option.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare
         and Social Security, and together we will do so.  To meet the health
         care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over
         the next 10 years.  <span class="economy">My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next
            year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new
            prescription drug benefit for low-income seniors.</span>  (Applause.)  No
         senior in America should have to choose between buying food and buying
         prescriptions.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not
            diverted in any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of
            the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and for Social Security
            alone.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling
         Americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must
         choose.  Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we
         will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits.
         (Applause.)  And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods,
         over the next five years we will double the number of people served at
         community health care centers.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage, yet
         worry their insurance company doesn't care and won't pay. Together this
         Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure doctors
         make medical decisions, and patients get the health care they deserve
         with a patients' bill of rights.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they
         need, not be forced to go to court because they didn't get it. We will
         ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims.  But
         first, let's put in place a strong, independent review   so we promote
         quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope
         to many who struggle with serious disease.  Our prayers tonight are with
         one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer -- a fine
         representative, and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley. (Applause.)  I
         can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the
         Congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the National
         Institutes of Health.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My new Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new
         technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more
         welcoming.  For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we
         need to break down barriers to equality. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our
               country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United
               States military.  (Applause.)  I'm requesting $5.7 billion in increased
               military pay and benefits, and health care and housing.  Our men and
               women in uniform give America their best and we owe them our support.</span></span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their
            military service.  I will honor our commitment to them with a
            million-dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and
            faster decisions on benefit claims.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of
            toxic brownfields.  And I propose we make a major investment in
            conservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
            (Applause.)  Our national parks have a special place in our country's
            life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history.  As good
            stewards, we must leave them better than we found them.  So I propose
            providing $4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of these national
            treasures. </span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the
            disadvantaged.  We must encourage and support the work of charities and
            faith-based and community groups that offer help and love one person at
            a time.  (Applause.)  These groups are working in every neighborhood in
            America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to
            provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children.
            Government should welcome these groups to apply for funds, not
            discriminate against them.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government
         should not fund religious activities.  (Applause.)  But our nation
         should support the good works of these good people who are helping their
         neighbors in need.  (Applause.)  <span class="economy">So I propose allowing all taxpayers,
            whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions.
            Estimates show this could encourage as much as $14 billion a year in new
            charitable giving, money that will save and change lives.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a
            federal compassion capital fund, with a focused and noble mission, to
            provide a mentor to the more than 100 million children with a parent in
            prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen
            pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia.  Please help me welcome
         Mayor John Street.  (Applause.)  Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based
         and community organizations to make a significant difference in
         Philadelphia.  He's invited me to his city this summer to see
         compassionate action.  I'm personally aware of just how effective the
         Mayor is.  Mayor Street's a Democrat.  (Applause.)  Let the record show,
         I lost his city, big time.  (Applause.)  But some things are bigger than
         politics.  So I look forward to coming to your city, to see your
         faith-based programs in action.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too
            many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice, when the
            law points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals.  All
            our citizens are created equal, and must be treated equally.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop
            specific recommendations to end racial profiling.  It's wrong and we
            will end it in America.  (Applause.)  In so doing, we will not hinder
            the work of our nation's brave police officers.</span>  They protect us every
         day -- often at great risk.  (Applause.)  But by stopping the abuses of
         a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and
         deserve. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations.
         It has funded our nation's important priorities.  It has protected
         Social Security and Medicare.  And our surpluses are big enough that
         there is still money left over.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt.  I
            listened, and I agree.  (Applause.)  We owe it to our children and
            grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2
            trillion in debt during the next 10 years.  (Applause.)  At the end of
            those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to
            retire.  (Applause.)  That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has
            ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the
         future.  We should approach our nation's budget as any prudent family
         would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending
         needs.  <span class="economy">For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase
            defense spending.  We may need to increase spending for our farmers or
            additional money to reform Medicare.  And so, my budget sets aside
            almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs.  That is
            one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this
            budget.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent.  We have funded
            our priorities.  We paid down all the available debt.  We have prepared
            for contingencies.</span> And we still have money left over.</p>
      <p>Yogi Berra once said, "When you come to a fork in the road, take it."
         (Laughter.)  Now, we come to a fork in the road; we have two choices.
         Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on
         more and bigger government.  That's the road our nation has traveled in
         recent years.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent.  That's far more than
            our economy grew, far more than personal income grew, and far more than
            the rate of inflation.  If you continue on that road, you will spend the
            surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills.
            (Applause.)</span>  Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to
         deficits, so we must take a different path.  (Applause.)  The other
         choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meet their
         own needs.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people.
         You see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and
         government is charging more than it needs.  The people of America have
         been overcharged and, on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Some say my tax plan is too big.  (Applause.)  Others say it's too
            small.  (Applause.)  I respectfully disagree.  (Laughter.)  This plan is
            just right.  (Applause.)  I didn't throw darts at the board to come up
            with a number for tax relief. </span> I didn't take a poll or develop an
         arbitrary formula that might sound good.  I looked at problems in the
         Tax Code and calculated the cost to fix them.</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we
               must lower the rate to 10 percent.  (Applause.)  No one should pay more
               than a third of the money they earn in federal income taxes, so we
               lowered the top rate to 33 percent. </span></span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">This reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses, which
            often pay taxes at the highest rate.  And help for small business means
            jobs for Americans.  (Applause.)  We simplified the Tax Code by reducing
            the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones,
            10 percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent.</span>  In my plan, no one is targeted in or
         targeted out.  Everyone who pays income taxes will get relief.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we
            reduced the marriage penalty.  (Applause.)  I want to help families rear
            and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per
            child.  (Applause.)  It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice --
            once when you earn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the
            death tax.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">These changes add up to significant help.  A typical family with two
            children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes.  Now,
            $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many
            families:  $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays
            tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family
            grocery bill for three months.</span> That's real money.</p>
      <p>With us tonight representing many American families are Steven and
         Josefina Ramos.  (Applause.)  They are from Pennsylvania.  (Applause.)
         But they could be from any one of your districts.  Steven is the network
         administrator for a school district.  Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a
         charter school.  And they have a two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal
            income taxes.  My plan will save them more than $2,000.  Let me tell you
            what Steven says:  "Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my
            family.  If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying
            off our personal debt in two years' time."  After that, Steven and
            Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's college education.</span></p>
      <p>My attitude is, government should never stand in the way of families
         achieving their dreams.  (Applause.)  And as we debate this issue,
         always remember, the surplus is not the government's money, the surplus
         is the people's money.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="poverty">For lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right
               now, complicated tax rules punish hard work.  A waitress supporting two
               children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional
               dollar she earns above the $25,000.  Her overtime, her hardest hours,
               are taxed at nearly 20 percent.  This sends a terrible message:  you'll
               never get ahead. But America's message must be different.  We must honor
               hard work, never punish it.  (Applause.)  With tax relief, overtime will
               no longer be over-taxed time for the waitress.</span></span>  (Applause.) People with
         the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions.  And
         millions of additional American families will be removed from the income
         tax rolls entirely.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent.  The long economic
            expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering.  Lower interest
            rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job
            all by themselves.</span></p>
      <p>Forty years ago, and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat,
         one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts
         to, in President Kennedy's words, get this country moving again.  They
         knew then what we must do now.  To create economic growth and
         opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy
         goods and create jobs.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must act quickly.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified
            before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic
            recovery.  So I want to work with you to give our economy an important
            jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.</span>  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We must act now because it is the right thing to do.  We must also act
         now because we have other things to do.  We must show courage to
         confront and resolve tough challenges, to restructure our nation's
         defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare
         and Social Security.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present
            peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism.  We will work
            with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of
            freedom. </span> We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom from
         oppression.  Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is
         their friend.  We will promote our values.  We will promote the peace.
         And we need a strong military to keep the peace.</p>
      <p><span class="war">But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past.  So
            I've asked the Secretary of Defense to review America's Armed Forces and
            prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats.</span> My budget makes a
         down payment on the research and development that will be required. Yet,
         in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then
         spending.  Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the
         other way around.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the
            21st century -- threats that are more widespread and less certain. They
            range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue
            nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction.</span>  To protect
         our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must
         deploy effective missile defenses.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and
            reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs.  (Applause.)  A
            strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom.</span></p>
      <p>Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend
         ourselves and our allies.  Freedom is exported every day, as we ship
         goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people.  Free
         trade brings greater political and personal freedom.  Each of the
         previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching
         trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of
         presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high cost of
            energy.  We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy
            policy.  (Applause.)  The West is confronting a major energy shortage
            that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty.</span>  I've asked federal
         agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of
         new energy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce
         Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior members in my
         administration to develop a national energy policy. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our energy demand outstrips our supply.  We can produce more energy at
            home while protecting our environment, and we must.  (Applause.) We can
            produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must.  (Applause.) We
            can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must.
            (Applause.)  America must become more energy-independent, and we will.
            (Applause.)</span></p>
      <p>Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming
         Medicare and Social Security.  Medicare's finances are strained and its
         coverage is outdated.  Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health
         plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare does not.
         The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux
         and Congressman Thomas, and now is the time to act.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Medicare must be modernized, and we must make sure that every senior on
         Medicare can choose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim
         Social Security benefits.  Every one in this chamber knows that Social
         Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement.  And we only
         have a couple of years to get prepared.  Without reform, this country
         will one day awaken to a stark choice:  either a drastic rise in payroll
         taxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits.</p>
      <p>There is a better way.  This spring I will form a presidential
         commission to reform Social Security.  The commission will make its
         recommendations by next fall.  Reform should be based on these
         principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and
         those nearing retirement.  It must return Social Security to sound
         financial footing. And it must offer personal savings accounts to
         younger workers who want them.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on
         the money they pay into the system.  To save the system, we must
         increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound
         investments that yield a higher rate of return.  Ownership, access to
         wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few.  They
         are the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of
         Social Security. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with
         our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can add
         to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign
         reforms.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation.
         America is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest.  Much has been
         given to us, and much is expected.  Let us agree to bridge old divides.
         But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to great
         goals.  Bipartisan is more than minding our matters.  It is doing our
         duty.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. As so
         many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the
         collected or divided conscience of our country.  And when we walk
         through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we're
         reminded of their courage and achievement.</p>
      <p>Yet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history.
         America's purpose always stands before us.  Our generation must show
         courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times
         of crisis.  And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and
         serve our country.  This is the privilege and responsibility we share.
         And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble.</p>
      <p>We all came here for a reason.  We all have things we want to accomplish
         and promises to keep.  Juntos podemos -- together we can. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We can make Americans proud of their government.  Together we can share
         in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and
         just, and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens the
         highest possible praise:  Well done, good and faithful servants.</p>
      <p>Thank you all.  Good night and God bless.  (Applause.)

      <h3>September 20, 2001</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, members of Congress, and fellow
         Americans:</p>
      <p>In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to
         report on the state of the Union.  Tonight, no such report is needed.
         It has already been delivered by the American people.</p>
      <p>We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to
         save others on the ground -- passengers like an exceptional man named
         Todd Beamer.  And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa
         Beamer, here tonight.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers,
         working past exhaustion.  We have seen the unfurling of flags, the
         lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers -- in
         English, Hebrew, and Arabic.  We have seen the decency of a loving and
         giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.</p>
      <p>My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen
         for itself the state of our Union -- and it is strong.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend
         freedom.  Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution.
         Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our
         enemies, justice will be done.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time.  All
         of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans
         and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol, singing "God
         Bless America." <span class="war"> And you did more than sing; you acted, by delivering
            $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our
            military</span>.</p>
      <p>Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and
         Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and
         for your service to our country.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its
         outpouring of support.  America will never forget the sounds of our
         National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris,
         and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.</p>
      <p>We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our
         embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in
         Cairo.  We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in
         Australia and Africa and Latin America.</p>
      <p>Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our
         own:  dozens of Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250
         citizens of India; men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and
         Japan; and hundreds of British citizens.  America has no truer friend
         than Great Britain.  (Applause.)   <span class="diplomacy">Once again, we are joined together in
            a great cause -- so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an
            ocean to show his unity of purpose with America.  Thank you for coming,
            friend. </span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war
            against our country.  Americans have known wars -- but for the past 136
            years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in
            1941. </span> Americans have known the casualties of war -- but not at the
         center of a great city on a peaceful morning.  Americans have known
         surprise attacks -- but never before on thousands of civilians.  All of
         this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a
         different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Americans have many questions tonight.  Americans are asking:  Who
            attacked our country?  The evidence we have gathered all points to a
            collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al
            Qaeda.  They are the same murderers indicted for bombing American
            embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the USS
            Cole</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime.  But its goal is not
            making money; its goal is remaking the world -- and imposing its radical
            beliefs on people everywhere</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been
            rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics -- a
            fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam.  The
            terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill
            all Americans, and make no distinction among military and civilians,
            including women and children.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">This group and its leader -- a person named Osama bin Laden -- are
            linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the
            Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.  There
            are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries.  They are
            recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps
            in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of
            terror.  They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries
            around the world to plot evil and destruction.</span></p>
      <p>The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and
         supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country.  In
         Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda's vision for the world.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Afghanistan's people have been brutalized -- many are starving and many
            have fled.  Women are not allowed to attend school.  You can be jailed
            for owning a television.  Religion can be practiced only as their
            leaders dictate.  A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not
            long enough.</span></p>
      <p>The United States respects the people of Afghanistan -- after all, we
         are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid -- but we condemn
         the Taliban regime.  (Applause.)  It is not only repressing its own
         people, it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering
         and supplying terrorists.  By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban
         regime is committing murder.</p>
      <p>And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on
         the Taliban:  Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al
         Qaeda who hide in your land. (Applause.)  Release all foreign nationals,
         including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned.  Protect
         foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your country.  Close
         immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in
         Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their
         support structure, to appropriate authorities.  (Applause.)  Give the
         United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make
         sure they are no longer operating.</p>
      <p>These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion.  (Applause.)
         The Taliban must act, and act immediately.  They will hand over the
         terrorists, or they will share in their fate.</p>
      <p>I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.
         We respect your faith.  It's practiced freely by many millions of
         Americans, and by millions more in countries that America counts as
         friends.  Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil
         in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah.  (Applause.)  The
         terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack
         Islam itself.  The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it
         is not our many Arab friends.  Our enemy is a radical network of
         terrorists, and every government that supports them.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.  It
            will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found,
            stopped and defeated. </span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Americans are asking, why do they hate us?  They hate what we see right
         here in this chamber -- a democratically elected government.  Their
         leaders are self-appointed.  They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of
         religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and
         disagree with each other.</p>
      <p>They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries,
         such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan.  They want to drive Israel out
         of the Middle East.  They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast
         regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
      <p>These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a
         way of life.  With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful,
         retreating from the world and forsaking our friends.  They stand against
         us, because we stand in their way.</p>
      <p>We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety.  We have seen their
         kind before.  They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the
         20th century.  By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions
         -- by abandoning every value except the will to power -- they follow in
         the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism.  And they will
         follow that path all the way, to where it ends:  in history's unmarked
         grave of discarded lies. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Americans are asking:  How will we fight and win this war?   We will
            direct every resource at our command -- every means of diplomacy, every
            tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every
            financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war -- to the
            disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a
            decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion.  It will not
            look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops
            were used and not a single American was lost in combat</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated
            strikes.  Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy
            campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen.  It may include dramatic
            strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success.
            We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another,
            drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest.
            And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.
            Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you
            are with us, or you are with the terrorists.</span>  (Applause.)  From this day
         forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will
         be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our nation has been put on notice:  We are not immune from attack.  We
            will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans.
            Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and
            local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security.
            These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. </span> So tonight I
         announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to
         me -- the Office of Homeland Security.</p>
      <p>And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this
         effort, to strengthen American security: a military veteran, an
         effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend -- Pennsylvania's
         Tom Ridge.  (Applause.)  He will lead, oversee and coordinate a
         comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against
         terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may come.</p>
      <p>These measures are essential.  But the only way to defeat terrorism as a
         threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it
         where it grows.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence
         operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty.  All deserve
         our thanks, and all have our prayers.  And tonight, a few miles from the
         damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military:  Be ready.  I've
         called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason.  The hour is
         coming when America will act, and you will make us proud.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>This is not, however, just America's fight.  And what is at stake is not
         just America's freedom.  This is the world's fight.  This is
         civilization's fight.  This is the fight of all who believe in progress
         and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We ask every nation to join us.  We will ask, and we will need, the help
            of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the
            world.  The United States is grateful that many nations and many
            international organizations have already responded -- with sympathy and
            with support.  Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to
            Europe, to the Islamic world.</span>  Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best
         the attitude of the world:  An attack on one is an attack on all.</p>
      <p>The civilized world is rallying to America's side.  They understand that
         if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may
         be next.  Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can
         threaten the stability of legitimate governments.  And you know what --
         we're not going to allow it.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Americans are asking:  What is expected of us?  I ask you to live your
         lives, and hug your children.  I know many citizens have fears tonight,
         and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing
         threat.</p>
      <p>I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have
         come here.  We are in a fight for our principles, and our first
         responsibility is to live by them.  No one should be singled out for
         unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or
         religious faith.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your
         contributions.  Those who want to give can go to a central source of
         information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing
         direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</p>
      <p>The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation
         may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.</p>
      <p>I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may
         accompany tighter security; and for your patience in what will be a long
         struggle.</p>
      <p>I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American
         economy.  Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity.  They did
         not touch its source.  America is successful because of the hard work,
         and creativity, and enterprise of our people.  These were the true
         strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our
         strengths today. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>And, finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and
         their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country.  Prayer
         has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey
         ahead.</p>
      <p>Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and
         for what you will do.  And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank
         you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what
         we will do together.</p>
      <p>Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges.  We will come
         together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air
         marshals on domestic flights, and take new measures to prevent
         hijacking.  We will come together to promote stability and keep our
         airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it
            needs to track down terror here at home.  (Applause.)  We will come
            together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans
            of terrorists before they act, and find them before they strike.
            (Applause.)</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's
            economy, and put our people back to work.</span></p>
      <p>Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of
         all New Yorkers:  Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
         (Applause.)  As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will
         work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we
         will rebuild New York City.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>After all that has just passed -- all the lives taken, and all the
         possibilities and hopes that died with them -- it is natural to wonder
         if America's future is one of fear.  Some speak of an age of terror.  I
         know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face.  But this country
         will define our times, not be defined by them.  As long as the United
         States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of
         terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Great harm has been done to us.  We have suffered great loss.  And in
         our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment.  Freedom
         and fear are at war.  The advance of human freedom -- the great
         achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time -- now depends
         on us.  Our nation -- this generation -- will lift a dark threat of
         violence from our people and our future.  We will rally the world to
         this cause by our efforts, by our courage.  We will not tire, we will
         not falter, and we will not fail.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return
         almost to normal.  We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is
         good.  Even grief recedes with time and grace.  But our resolve must not
         pass.  Each of us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it
         happened.  We'll remember the moment the news came -- where we were and
         what we were doing.  Some will remember an image of a fire, or a story
         of rescue.  Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.</p>
      <p>And I will carry this:  It is the police shield of a man named George
         Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others.  It
         was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son.
         This is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it.
         I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this
         struggle for freedom and security for the American people.</p>
      <p>The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain.
         Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we
         know that God is not neutral between them.  (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice -- assured of
         the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come.  In
         all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over
         the United States of America.</p>
      <p>Thank you.  (Applause.)
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_29,_2002" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>George W. Bush</h2>
      <h3>January 29, 2002</h3>
      <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of
         Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: <span class="war">As we gather tonight,
            our nation is at war,</span> <span class="economy">our economy is in recession</span>, and the civilized
         world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union has never
         been stronger. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In four short months, our
         nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the
         Pentagon, <span class="war">rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the
            world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist
            training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from
            brutal oppression.</span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p>The American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who
         once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay.
         (Applause.) And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their
         lives are running for their own. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We'll be partners
         in rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcome the
         distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid
         Karzai. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of
            Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or
            going to school. Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's new
            government. And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Doctor
            Sima Samar</span>. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the
            resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States
            military. (Applause.) When I called our troops into action, I did so
            with complete confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight, thanks
            to them, we are winning the war on terror. (Applause.) The men and women
            of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of
            the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents,
            on mountaintops and in caves--you will not escape the justice of this
            nation.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>For many Americans, these four months have brought sorrow, and pain that
         will never completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter returns
         to Ground Zero, to feel closer to his two sons who died there. At a
         memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note for his
         lost father: Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven. I don't want to
         play football until I can play with you again some day.</p>
      <p>Last month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, a CIA officer and
         Marine who died in Mazur-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of
         farewell: "Semper Fi, my love." Shannon is with us tonight. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause
         is just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and
         all who gave their lives for freedom.</p>
      <p>Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan
         confirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true scope of the task
         ahead. We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos, where
         they laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of their
         hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. We have
         found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water
         facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons,
         surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of
         landmarks in America and throughout the world.</p>
      <p>What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there,
         our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who
         hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's
         camps, and so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous
         killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw
         regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs,
         set to go off without warning.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition
         partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet, tens of
         thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies view
         the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they
         are. (Applause.) <span class="war">So long as training camps operate, so long as nations
            harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk. And America and our allies must
            not, and will not, allow it.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in
            the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist
            camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And,
            second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical,
            biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the
            world.</span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of
            business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. </span>A
         terrorist underworld--including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic
         Jihad, Jaish-i-Mohammed--operates in remote jungles and deserts, and
         hides in the centers of large cities.</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="diplomacy">While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is
               acting elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to
               train that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have
               executed an American, and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working
               with the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb
               our embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the
               shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia</span></span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">My hope is that all nations will heed our call, and eliminate the
            terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own. Many
            nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror,
            and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf. </span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">But some governments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no
            mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from
            threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass
            destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since
            September the 11th. But we know their true nature. North Korea is a
            regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while
            starving its citizens</span>.</p>
      <p>Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an
         unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support
            terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas,
            and nuclear weapons for over a decade.</span> This is a regime that has already
         used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens--leaving the
         bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime
         that agreed to international inspections--then kicked out the
         inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the
         civilized world.</p>
      <p><span class="war">States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of
            evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. </span>By seeking weapons of
         mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They
         could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match
         their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the
         United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be
         catastrophic.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their
            state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and
            deliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy
            effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden
            attack.</span> (Applause.) And all nations should know: America will do what is
         necessary to ensure our nation's security.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on
            events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws closer
            and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's
            most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive
            weapons.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign may
            not be finished on our watch--yet it must be and it will be waged on our
            watch.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">&gt;We can't stop short. If we stop now--leaving terror camps intact and
            terror states unchecked--our sense of security would be false and
            temporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it
            is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our first priority must always be the security of our nation, and that
            will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports
            three great goals for America: We will win this war; we'll protect our
            homeland;</span> <span class="economy">and we will revive our economy.</span></p>
      <p>September the 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in this
         Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and
         resolve. (Applause.) Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit
         directed toward addressing problems here at home. I'm a proud member of
         my party--yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create
         jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans,
         not as Democrats, but as Americans. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">It costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion
               dollars a month--over $30 million a day--and we must be prepared for
               future operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons
               defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them. We
               need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile, to put
               our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely. Our men and women
               in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best
               training--and they also deserve another pay raise.</span></span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two
               decades --because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is
               never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.</span></span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect
            our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of
            another attack. Time and distance from the events of September the 11th
            will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons. America is no
            longer protected by vast oceans. We are protected from attack only by
            vigorous action abroad, and increased vigilance at home</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="war">My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland
            security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response,
            airport and border security, and improved intelligence. We will develop
            vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases. We'll increase
            funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police
            and firefighters. (Applause.) We will improve intelligence collection
            and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of
            air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of
            visitors to the United States</span>. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Homeland security will make America not only stronger, but, in many
            ways, better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve
            public health. Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer
            neighborhoods. Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal
            drugs. (Applause.) And as government works to better secure our
            homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert
            citizens.</span></p>
      <p>A few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a
         passenger lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the
         man, who had been trained by al Qaeda and was armed with explosives. The
         people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly
         200 lives. And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis
         Moutardier and Christina Jones. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war"><span class="economy">Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the
               final great priority of my budget is economic security for the American
               people. (Applause.) To achieve these great national objectives--to win
               the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy--our budget
               will run a deficit that will be small and short-term, so long as
               Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner.
               (Applause.) We have clear priorities and we must act at home with the
               same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas: We'll prevail in the
               war, and we will defeat this recession. </span></span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="poverty">Americans who have lost their jobs need our help and I support extending
            unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage.
            (Applause.) Yet, American workers want more than unemployment checks--
            they want a steady paycheck. (Applause.) When America works, America
            prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word:
            jobs.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start.
         (Applause.) Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve
         historic education reform so that no child is left behind. I was proud
         to work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and
         Congressman George Miller. (Applause.) Senator Judd Gregg. (Applause.)
         And I was so proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my
         friend, Ted Kennedy. (Laughter and applause.) I know the folks at the
         Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say such a
         thing--(laughter)--but our work on this bill shows what is possible if
         we set aside posturing and focus on results. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>There is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and succeed
         in school with improved Head Start and early childhood development
         programs. (Applause.) We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher
         training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for
         America: a quality teacher in every classroom. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress
            must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build
            infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so
            America is less dependent on foreign oil.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates new
         jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority.
         (Applause.) On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of
         Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass
         this legislation. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. (Applause.) Last year, some in
            this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was
            too big. (Applause.) But when the checks arrived in the mail, most
            Americans thought tax relief was just about right. (Applause.) Congress
            listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the
            child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term growth
            and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts
            permanent.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the
            economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment, and by
            speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend. For the sake
            of American workers, let's pass a stimulus package.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these
            important reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce
            dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health
            security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients' bill
            of rights--(applause)--to give uninsured workers credits to help buy
            health coverage--(applause)--to approve an historic increase in the
            spending for veterans' health--(applause)--and to give seniors a sound
            and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription
            drugs.</span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to
            enact new safeguards for 401K and pension plans. (Applause.) Employees
            who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk
            losing everything if their company fails. (Applause.) Through stricter
            accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate
            America must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and
            held to the highest standards of conduct.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social
         Security, and we will. We must make Social Security financially stable
         and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose
         them. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other
            issues: productive farm policy--(applause)--a cleaner
            environment--(applause) --broader home ownership, especially among
            minorities--(applause)--and ways to encourage the good work of charities
            and faith-based groups. (Applause.)</span> <span class="war">I ask you to join me on these
            important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've
            applied to our war against terrorism.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see
         the true character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies
         believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in
         fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and
         compassion, strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the
         families, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in
         awe of the American people.</p>
      <p>And I hope you will join me--I hope you will join me in expressing
         thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings
         to our nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th.
         Yet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked
         into a mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are
         citizens, with obligations to each other, to our country, and to
         history. We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate, and more
         about the good we can do.</p>
      <p>For too long our culture has said, "If it feels good, do it." Now
         America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: "Let's roll."
         (Applause.) In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of
         firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we
         have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We
         want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self. We've been
         offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two
         years--4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime--to the service of
         your neighbors and your nation. (Applause.) Many are already serving,
         and I thank you. If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place
         to start. To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I
         invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom Corps will
         focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home;
         rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout
         the world.</p>
      <p>One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America
         needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major
         emergencies; volunteers to help police and fire departments;
         transportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.</p>
      <p>Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We
         need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in
         prison. And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA
         Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and
         Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.</p>
      <p>And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to
         every part of the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace
         Corps, double its volunteers over the next five years--(applause)--and
         ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and
         opportunity in the Islamic world. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity--a moment
         we must seize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of
         millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can
         overcome evil with greater good. (Applause.) And we have a great
         opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values
         that will bring lasting peace.</p>
      <p>All fathers and mothers, in all societies, want their children to be
         educated, and live free from poverty and violence. No people on Earth
         yearn to be oppressed, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the
         midnight knock of the secret police.</p>
      <p>If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic
         "street" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration. Let the
         skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of
         learning, and tolerance and progress. America will lead by defending
         liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for
         all people everywhere. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We
         have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand
         firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law;
         limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property;
         free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these
         values around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a
         greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. We
         seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.</p>
      <p>In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries.
         <span class="diplomacy">America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have
            never before, to achieve peace and prosperity.</span> In every region, free
         markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to
         lift lives. Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, and
         Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror
         cannot stop the momentum of freedom. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return
         to normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will. Those of us
         who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by
         them. We've come to know truths that we will never question: evil is
         real, and it must be opposed. (Applause.) Beyond all differences of race
         or creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger
         together. Deep in the American character, there is honor, and it is
         stronger than cynicism. And many have discovered again that even in
         tragedy--especially in tragedy--God is near. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in
         the history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in human
         events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.</p>
      <p>Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and
         murder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand
         for a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our founding. We
         affirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's
         price. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my
         fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory.</p>
      <p>Thank you all. May God bless. (Applause.)

      <h3>January 28, 2003</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished
         guests, fellow citizens:</p>
      <p>Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of
         the union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive
         days that lie ahead.</p>
      <p>You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this
         session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital
         to our country...and we have the opportunity to save millions of lives
         abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is
         broadly shared...<span class="war">and we will answer every danger and every enemy that
            threatens the American people.</span></p>
      <p>In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident.
         In a whirlwind of change, and hope, and peril, our faith is sure, our
         resolve is firm, and our union is strong.</p>
      <p>This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore,
         we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, other
         presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus, and
         clarity, and courage.</p>
      <p>During the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we
         work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved
         historic education reform - which must now be carried out in every
         school, and every classroom, so that every child in America can read,
         and learn, and succeed in life. <span class="war">To protect our country, we reorganized
            our government and created the Department of Homeland Security - which
            is mobilizing against the threats of a new era.</span> <span class="economy">To bring our economy out
            of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation.</span> To
         insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms, and
         we are holding corporate criminals to account.</p>
      <p>Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I
         ask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our
         fellow citizens.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough
            to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">After recession</span>, <span class="war">terrorist attacks,</span> corporate scandals, <span class="economy">and stock market
            declines, our economy is recovering - yet it is not growing fast enough,
            or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our Nation needs more
            small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more
            employers to put up the sign that says, "Help Wanted."</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Jobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when
            Americans have more money to spend and invest; and the best, fairest way
            to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the
            first place.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006
            be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as
            I have signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in
            workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty,
            we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to a
            thousand dollars, we should send the checks to American families now.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">This tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes - and it will help
            our economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans will keep - this
            year - an average of almost 1,100 dollars more of their own money. A
            family of four with an income of 40,000 dollars would see their federal
            income taxes fall from 1,178 dollars to 45 dollars per year. And our
            plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small
            businesses.</span></p>
      <p>You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and
         promised them for future years. <span class="economy">If this tax relief is good for Americans
            three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans
            today</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax
            laws. It is fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax
            the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence, and
            to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask
            you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More
            jobs mean more taxpayers - and higher revenues to our government. The
            best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to
            encourage economic growth - and to show some spending discipline in
            Washington, D.C. </span>We must work together to fund only our most important
         priorities. I will send you a budget that increases discretionary
         spending by four percent next year - about as much as the average
         family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for
         us: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of
         American families.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">A growing economy, and a focus on essential priorities, will also be
            crucial to the future of Social Security</span>. As we continue to work
         together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer
         younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will
         control and they will own.</p>
      <p>Our second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all
         Americans.</p>
      <p>The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation -
         with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for
         many people, medical care costs too much - and many have no coverage at
         all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care
         system that dictates coverage and rations care. Instead, we must work
         toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance
         policy...choose their own doctors..and seniors and <span class="poverty">low-income Americans
            receive the help they need.</span> Instead of bureaucrats, and trial lawyers,
         and HMOs, we must put doctors, and nurses, and patients back in charge
         of American medicine.</p>
      <p>Health care reform must begin with Medicare, because Medicare is the
         binding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by
         giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are
         transforming health care in America.</p>
      <p>Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep
         their coverage just the way it is. And just like you, the members of
         Congress, members of your staffs, and other federal employees, all
         seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides
         prescription drugs. <span class="economy">My budget will commit an additional 400 billion
            dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare.</span> Leaders
         of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening
         Medicare - I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.</p>
      <p>To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime
         causes of higher costs - the constant threat that physicians and
         hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation,
         everybody pays more for health care - and many parts of America are
         losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit
         - and I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while
            dramatically improving the environment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency
            and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more
            energy at home.</span> I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a
         70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15
         years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the
         catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn
         away millions of acres of treasured forest.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment
            and our economy.</span> Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step, and
         protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not
         have imagined. In this century, the greatest environmental progress will
         come about, not through endless lawsuits or command and control
         regulations, but through technology and innovation. Tonight I am
         proposing 1.2 billion dollars in research funding so that America can
         lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.</p>
      <p>A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy,
         which can be used to power a car - producing only water, not exhaust
         fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will
         overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom - so
         that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by
         hydrogen, and pollution-free. Join me in this important innovation - to
         make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent
         on foreign sources of energy.</p>
      <p>Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest
         problems of America. <span class="poverty">For so many in our country - the homeless, the
            fatherless, the addicted - the need is great</span>. Yet there is power -
         wonder-working power - in the goodness, and idealism, and faith of the
         American people.</p>
      <p>Americans are doing the work of compassion every day - visiting
         prisoners, providing shelter to battered women, bringing companionship
         to lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise...they deserve
         our personal support...and, when appropriate, they deserve the
         assistance of our government. I urge you to pass both my faith-based
         initiative and the Citizen Service Act - to encourage acts of compassion
         that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time.</p>
      <p>Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in USA Freedom
         Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across
         America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the
         spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some
         of our most vulnerable citizens - boys and girls trying to grow up
         without guidance and attention...and children who have to go through a
         prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad. I propose a 450 million
         dollar initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged
         junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support
         the training and recruiting of mentors, yet it is the men and women of
         America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person, can change a
         life forever - and I urge you to be that one person.</p>
      <p>Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds
         out friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness
         of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting
         illegal drugs by cutting off supplies, and reducing demand through
         anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight
         against drugs is a fight for their own lives.</p>
      <p>Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I
         propose a new 600 million dollar program to help an additional 300,000
         Americans receive treatment over the next three years.</p>
      <p>Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One
         of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
         A man in the program said, "God does miracles in people .s lives, and
         you never think it could be you." Tonight, let us bring to all Americans
         who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of
         recovery is possible, and it could be you.</p>
      <p>By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women
         who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society - a culture
         that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook the
         weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of
         birth, and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no
         human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I
         ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all
         human cloning.</p>
      <p>The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America
         also determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more
         than our power and our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to
         the cause of human dignity - the rights of every person and the
         possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to
         help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of
         evil men. <span class="civil-rights">In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed
            people...and we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild
            their society, and educate all their children - boys and girls.</span> <span class="poverty">In the
            Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and
            a democratic Palestine. Across the earth, America is feeding the hungry;
            more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the
            people of the United States.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer,
            we must also remember our calling, as a blessed country, to make this
            world better</span>. Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million
         people have the AIDS virus - including three million children under the
         age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third
         of the adult population carries the infection. More than four million
         require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000
         AIDS victims - only 50,000 - are receiving the medicine they need.</p>
      <p>Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not
         seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural
         South Africa describes his frustration. He says, "We have no
         medicines..many hospitals tell [people], 'You've got AIDS. We can't help
         you. Go home and die.' "</p>
      <p>In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those
         words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for
         many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12,000 dollars
         a year to under 300 dollars a year - which places a tremendous
         possibility within our grasp.</p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity
         to do so much for so many. We have confronted, and will continue to
         confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent
         crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief - a
         work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the
         people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new
         AIDS infections...treat at least two million people with life-extending
         drugs...and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from
         AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit 15
         billion dollars over the next five years, including nearly ten billion
         dollars in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most
         afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague
         of nature. <span class="war">And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and
            defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">There are days when the American people do not hear news about the war
            on terror. There is never a day when I do not learn of another threat,
            or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this
            global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and
            we are winning.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">To date we have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key commanders
            of al-Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for
            the September 11th attacks...the chief of al-Qaida operations in the
            Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa
            and the USS Cole...an al-Qaida operations chief from Southeast Asia...a
            former director of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan...a key
            al-Qaida operative in Europe..and a major al-Qaida leader in Yemen. All
            told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many
            countries. And many others have met a different fate. They are no longer
            a problem for the United States and our friends and allies.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks.</span><span class="war">
            America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist
            conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen...the American
            embassy in Singapore...a Saudi military base...and ships in the straits
            of Hormuz, and the straits of Gibraltar. We have broken al-Qaida cells
            in Hamburg, and Milan, and Madrid, and London, and Paris - as well as
            Buffalo, New York.</span></p>
      <p>We have the terrorists on the run, and we are keeping them on the run.
         One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.</p>
      <p><span class="war">As we fight this war, we will remember where it began - here, in our own
            country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our
            people and defend our homeland. We have intensified security at the
            borders and ports of entry...posted more than 50,000 newly trained
            federal screeners in airports...begun inoculating troops and first
            responders against smallpox...and are deploying the Nation's first early
            warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year,
            for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this
            Nation against ballistic missiles.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to
            add to our future security with a major research and production effort
            to guard our people against bio-terrorism, called Project Bioshield. The
            budget I send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly
            make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like
            anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our
            enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the
            dangers are upon us.</span></p>
      <p>Since September 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have
         worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The
         FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and transforming
         itself to meet new threats. And tonight, I am instructing the leaders of
         the FBI, Central Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Department of
         Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and
         analyze all threat information in a single location.<span class="war"> Our government must
            have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure
            the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our war against terror is a contest of will, in which perseverance is
            power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon,
            on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that
            pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the
            difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs
            of men...free people will set the course of history.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror...the gravest danger
            facing America and the world...is outlaw regimes that seek and possess
            nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such
            weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or
            sell those weapons to their terrorist allies, who would use them without
            the least hesitation</span>.</p>
      <p>This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. <span class="war">Throughout the 20th
            century, small groups of men seized control of great nations...built
            armies and arsenals..and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the
            world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit.
            In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were
            defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great
            alliances, and by the might of the United States of America. Now, in
            this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again,
            and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this
            Nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and
            a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend
            the safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept
            this responsibility.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these
            dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter,
            and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We are strongly supporting the
            International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control
            nuclear materials around the world.</span> <span class="diplomacy">We are working with other
            governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and
            to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of
            missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to
            follow a process - it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible
            threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in
            preventing sudden and catastrophic attack. We are asking them to join
            us, and many are doing so.</span> Yet the course of this Nation does not depend
         on the decisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action
         is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American
         people.</p>
      <p>Different threats require different strategies. <span class="civil-rights">In Iran, we continue to
            see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass
            destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking
            intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty, human rights, and
            democracy.</span> Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own
         government, and determine their own destiny - and the United States
         supports their aspirations to live in freedom.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in
            fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a
            negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons.</span>
         We now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and developing
         those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its
         nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the
         world will not be blackmailed. <span class="diplomacy">America is working with the countries of
            the region - South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia - to find a peaceful
            solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons
            will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship.
            The North Korean regime will find respect in the world, and revival for
            its people, only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.</span></p>
      <p>Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula,
         and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal
         dictator, with a history of reckless aggression..with ties to
         terrorism... with great potential wealth...will not be permitted to
         dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last
            casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed
            to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he
            systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological,
            and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country.</span> Nothing
         to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons - not
         economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even
         cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. Almost three months
         ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final
         chance to disarm. He has shown instead his utter contempt for the United
         Nations, and for the opinion of the world.</p>
      <p>The 108 UN weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt
         for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of
         the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to
         Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons...lay those
         weapons out for the world to see...and destroy them as directed. Nothing
         like this has happened.</p>
      <p>The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological
         weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -
         enough doses to kill several million people. He has not accounted for
         that material. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it.</p>
      <p>The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials
         sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin -
         enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He
         has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he
         has destroyed it.</p>
      <p>Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the
         materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve
         agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents also could kill untold
         thousands. He has not accounted for these materials. He has given no
         evidence that he has destroyed them.</p>
      <p>U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000
         munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently
         turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their
         existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of
         these prohibited munitions. He has given no evidence that he has
         destroyed them.</p>
      <p>From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had
         several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce
         germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to place to evade
         inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has
         given no evidence that he has destroyed them.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that
            Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had
            a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods
            of enriching uranium for a bomb. </span>The British government has learned that
         Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from
         Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to
         purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons
         production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities.
         He clearly has much to hide.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving.</span>
         From intelligence sources, we know, for instance, that thousands of
         Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from
         the UN inspectors - sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the
         inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order
         to intimidate witnesses. Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights
         requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing
         as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists
         have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. And intelligence
         sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who
         cooperate with UN inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along
         with their families.</p>
      <p>Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent
         enormous sums, taken great risks, to build and keep weapons of mass
         destruction - but why? The only possible explanation, the only possible
         use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or
         attack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological
         weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the
         Middle East, and create deadly havoc in the region. And this Congress
         and the American people must recognize another threat.<span class="war"> Evidence from
            intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people
            now in custody, reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists,
            including members of al-Qaida. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he
            could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them
            develop their own.</span></p>
      <p>Before September 11, 2001, many in the world believed that Saddam
         Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents and lethal viruses and
         shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19
         hijackers with other weapons, and other plans - this time armed by
         Saddam Hussein. It would take just one vial, one canister, one crate
         slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have
         ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that day
         never comes.</p>
      <p>Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when
         have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting
         us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully
         and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations
         would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam
         Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.</p>
      <p>This dictator, who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, has
         already used them on whole villages - leaving thousands of his own
         citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced
         confessions are obtained - by torturing children while their parents are
         made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other
         methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning
         with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric
         drills, cutting out tongues, and rape.</p>
      <p>If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. And tonight I have a
         message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not
         surrounding your country - your enemy is ruling your country. And the
         day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your
         liberation.</p>
      <p><span class="war">The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not
            accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, our friends, and
            our allies. The United States will ask the UN Security Council to
            convene on February 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance
            of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and
            intelligence about Iraq's illegal weapons programs; its attempts to hide
            those weapons from inspectors; and its links to terrorist groups</span>. We
         will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein
         does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people, and for the peace
         of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.</p>
      <p>Tonight I also have a message for the men and women who will keep the
         peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling
         in and near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lie ahead. In
         those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training
         has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and
         America believes in you.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a president
            can make. The technologies of war have changed. The risks and suffering
            of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory
            is free from sorrow. </span>This Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the
         cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come.</p>
      <p><span class="war">We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be
            defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at
            all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just
            means - sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced
            upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United
            States military - and we will prevail.</span> And as we and our coalition
         partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people
         food, and medicines, and supplies...and freedom.</p>
      <p>Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In
         two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an
         awareness of peril...from bitter division in small matters to calm unity
         in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of
         history has come to the right country.</p>
      <p>Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our
         time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world,
         and to ourselves.</p>
      <p>America is a strong Nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We
         exercise power without conquest, and sacrifice for the liberty of
         strangers.</p>
      <p>
         Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every
         person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not
         America's gift to the world, it is God;s gift to humanity.</p>
      <p>We Americans have faith in ourselves - but not in ourselves alone. We do
         not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them,
         placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of
         history.</p>
      <p>May He guide us now, and may God continue to bless the United States of
         America.</p>
      <p>Thank you.

      <h3>January 20, 2004</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished
         guests, and fellow citizens: America this evening is a nation called to
         great responsibilities. And we are rising to meet them.</p>
      <p><span class="war">As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American servicemen and
            women are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing
            hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are
            making America more secure.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are
            tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger
            lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are
            patrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting
            America.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the
            world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you
            passed is working.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Tonight, members of Congress can take pride in the great works of
         compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You're
         raising the standards for our public schools, and you are giving our
         senior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We
         can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the
         dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes
         are no threat to us. <span class="economy">We can press on with economic growth</span>, and reforms
         in education and Medicare, or we can turn back to old policies and old
         divisions.</p>
      <p>We've not come all this way -- through tragedy, and trial and war --
         only to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to
         the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us. In their
         efforts, their enterprise, and their character, the American people are
         showing that the state of our union is confident and strong. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American
            people. Twenty-eight months have passed since September 11th, 2001 --
            over two years without an attack on American soil. And it is tempting to
            believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable,
            comforting -- and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta,
            Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The
            terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world</span>. And
         by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give
            our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need
            to defend us.</span> And one of those essential tools is the Patriot Act, which
         allows federal law enforcement to better share information, to track
         terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For
         years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug
         traffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are
         even more important for hunting terrorists. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire next year.
         (Applause.) The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule.
         (Applause.) Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect
         our citizens. You need to renew the Patriot Act. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war.
            Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th,
            awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities.
            Last August the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who
            was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people.
            We're tracking al Qaeda around the world, and nearly two-thirds of their
            known leaders have now been captured or killed. Thousands of very
            skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt, going
            after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and one by
            one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the
            regimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply them with
            nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</span> The United States and our
         allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate
         danger. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made
            Afghanistan the primary training base of al Qaeda killers.</span> <span class="civil-rights">As of this
            month, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections
            and full participation by women.</span> Businesses are opening, health care
         centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are
         back in school. With the help from the new Afghan army, our coalition is
         leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the Taliban
         and al Qaeda. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation
         that is free and proud and fighting terror -- and America is honored to
         be their friend. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Since we last met in this chamber, <span class="war">combat forces of the United States,
            Great Britain, Australia, Poland and other countries enforced the
            demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein, and the
            people of Iraq are free. </span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Having broken the Baathist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam
            supporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed
            and attack from the shadows. These killers, joined by foreign
            terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger.</span> Yet we're making progress
         against them. The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole,
         and now sits in a prison cell. (Applause.) Of the top 55 officials of
         the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Our forces are on the
         offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day and conducting an average of
         180 raids a week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq, just as
         surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America
         has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last
         January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our
         coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic
         law, with a bill of rights. We're working with Iraqis and the United
         Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end
         of June.</p>
      <p>As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in
         their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the
         will of our country and our friends, but the United States of America
         will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. (Applause.) The
         killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own
         security and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome one
         of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current President of the Iraqi
         Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi.</p>
      <p>Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free
         and peaceful nation. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for
         the better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to
         disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction
         programs, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons.
         Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off
         and far more secure without weapons of mass murder. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and
            Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with
            Iraq did not. And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective,
            words must be credible, and no one can now doubt the word of America.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Different threats require different strategies. <span class="war">Along with nations in
            the region, we're insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear
            program. America and the international community are demanding that Iran
            meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is
            committed to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands
            of the most dangerous regimes.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the
         police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended, and
         a task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete
         commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies. And this
         pledge, given by one, has been kept by many.</p>
      <p><span class="war">You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense, and
            cast the difficult votes of war and peace.</span> Our closest allies have been
         unwavering. America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been
         skilled and tireless. And the men and women of the American military --
         they have taken the hardest duty. We've seen their skill and their
         courage in armored charges and midnight raids, and lonely hours on
         faithful watch. We have seen the joy when they return, and felt the
         sorrow when one is lost. I've had the honor of meeting our servicemen
         and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific to a
         mess hall in Baghdad.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Many of our troops are listening tonight. And I want you and your
            families to know: America is proud of you. And my administration, and
            this Congress, will give you the resources you need to fight and win the
            war on terror.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all.
            They view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with
            law enforcement and indictments.</span> After the World Trade Center was first
         attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted and tried and
         convicted, and sent to prison. But the matter was not settled. The
         terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations, and
         drawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of
         September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal
         papers. <span class="war">The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United
            States, and war is what they got. </span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p>Some in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the liberation
         of Iraq. <span class="war">Objections to war often come from principled motives. But let
            us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power.
            We're seeking all the facts. Already, the Kay Report identified dozens
            of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and
            significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United
            Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictatator's weapons of mass
            destruction programs would continue to this day.</span> Had we failed to act,
         Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty
         threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance by
         dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be
         filled with victims, terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq
         -- where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished
         into the sands -- would still be known only to the killers. For all who
         love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a
         better and safer place. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized.
         <span class="diplomacy">This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain,
            Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain,
            Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands --
            (applause) -- Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have
            committed troops to Iraq.</span> (Applause.) As we debate at home, we must
         never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners, or
         dismiss their sacrifices.</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">From the beginning, America has sought international support for our
            operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support.
            There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many
            nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never
            seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater
         Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and
         condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are
         incompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has
         planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom. And even
         when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and
         anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the
         safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward
         strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the
         enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher
         standard from our friend. To cut through the barriers of hateful
         propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are
         expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian -- and soon, a new
         television service will begin providing reliable news and information
         across the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of
         the National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the
         development of free elections, and free markets, free press, and free
         labor unions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the
         historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can
         light the way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the
         world. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>America is a nation with a mission, and that mission comes from our most
         basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire.
         Our aim is a democratic peace -- a peace founded upon the dignity and
         rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with friends
         and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This
         great republic will lead the cause of freedom. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">In the last three years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental
            strengths of the American economy. We have come through recession, and
            terrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war.
            And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this
            economy is strong, and growing stronger.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">You have doubled the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000, reduced the
            marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on
            capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and
            you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy
            forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was
            the fastest in nearly 20 years; new home construction, the highest in
            almost 20 years; home ownership rates, the highest ever. Manufacturing
            activity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low.
            Exports are growing. Productivity is high, and jobs are on the rise.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far
         better than government would have -- and you were right to return it.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">America's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology
            transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more
            productive, and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be
            found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we
            must respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs
            in our new economy.</span></p>
      <p>All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed
         to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for
         too many children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No
         Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law
         of our country. We're providing more funding for our schools -- a
         36-percent increase since 2001. We're requiring higher standards. We are
         regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We are reporting
         results to parents, and making sure they have better options when
         schools are not performing. We are making progress toward excellence for
         every child in America. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No
         Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet the
         results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect third
         graders to read and do math at the third grade level -- and that's not
         asking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help students
         who are falling behind. This nation will not go back to the days of
         simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them
         learning the basics. I refuse to give up on any child -- and the No
         Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of
         America's children. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain
         the skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest growing
         occupations require strong math and science preparation, and training
         beyond the high school level. So tonight, I propose a series of measures
         called Jobs for the 21st Century.<span class="poverty"> This program will provide extra help
            to middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math,
            expand advanced placement programs in low-income schools, invite math
            and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in
            our high schools. </span>I propose larger Pell grants for students who prepare
         for college with demanding courses in high school. (Applause.) I propose
         increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they
         can -- (applause.) I do so, so they can train workers for industries
         that are creating the most new jobs. By all these actions, we'll help
         more and more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our
         country. Job training is important, and so is job creation.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">We must continue to pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda.
            (Applause.) Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes.
            The tax reductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act --
            (applause) -- unless you act -- unless you act, the unfair tax on
            marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will be
            charged $300 more in federal taxes for every child. Unless you act,
            small businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the death tax
            will eventually come back to life. Unless you act, Americans face a tax
            increase. </span>What Congress has given, the Congress should not take away.
         For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and
         employees with relief from needless federal regulation, and protect them
         from junk and frivolous lawsuits. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our
            economy run -- so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our
            electricity system, promote conservation, and make America less
            dependent on foreign sources of energy.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new
         markets for America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers -- to
         create jobs for American workers. Younger workers should have the
         opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security
         taxes in a personal retirement account. (Applause.) We should make the
         Social Security system a source of ownership for the American people.
         (Applause.)<span class="economy"> And we should limit the burden of government on this economy
            by acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy"><span class="war">In two weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the
               homeland, and meets important domestic needs, while limiting the growth
               in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent.</span> (Applause.) This will
            require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be
            wise with the people's money. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in
            half over the next five years.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Tonight, I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect
         our values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary worker
         program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no
         Americans can be found to fill the job. This reform will be good for our
         economy because employers will find needed workers in an honest and
         orderly system. A temporary worker program will help protect our
         homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law enforcement to focus on true
         threats to our national security.</p>
      <p>I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal
         immigration, and unfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary
         worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect
         the law, while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from
         the shadows of American life. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Our nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of
         change. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives.
         This dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising
         costs of medical care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we must
         work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of
         modern medicine throughout our country. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and two months ago, you
         showed the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug
         benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are giving them
         the modern medicine they deserve. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to
            receive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the
            retail price of most prescription drugs -- and millions of low-income
            seniors can get an additional $600 to buy medicine.</span> Beginning next year,
         seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against
         diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can
         receive wellness exams.</p>
      <p>In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under
         Medicare. For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not
         have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly
         in half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their
         Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits
         them best -- just as you, as members of Congress, can choose an
         insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year, millions
         of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical
         expenses in a health savings account. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of
         our seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under
         Medicare, will meet my veto. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that
         Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best
         fits their individual needs. To make insurance more affordable, Congress
         must act to address rapidly rising health care costs. Small businesses
         should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates,
         so they can cover more workers with health insurance. I urge you to pass
         association health plans. (Applause.) I ask you to give lower-income
         Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their
         own basic health insurance. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical
         mistakes, reduce costs, and improve care. To protect the doctor-patient
         relationship, and keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate
         wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits. (Applause.) And tonight I
         propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage, as
         part of our new health savings accounts, be allowed to deduct 100
         percent of the premiums from their taxes. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>A government-run health care system is the wrong prescription.
         (Applause.) By keeping costs under control, expanding access, and
         helping more Americans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of
         private medicine that makes America's health care the best in the world.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We are living in a time of great change -- in our world, in our economy,
         in science and medicine. Yet some things endure -- courage and
         compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith
         and race. The values we try to live by never change. And they are
         instilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families and
         schools and religious congregations. These institutions, these unseen
         pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will
         defend them. We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy,
         responsible children. When it comes to helping children make right
         choices, there is work for all of us to do.</p>
      <p>One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their
         lives and futures on drugs. Our government is helping parents confront
         this problem with aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement.
         Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the last two
         years. Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs
         than in the year 2001. (Applause.) In my budget, I proposed new funding
         to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce demand
         for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an
         effective part of this effort. So tonight I proposed an additional $23
         million for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save
         children's lives. The aim here is not to punish children, but to send
         them this message: We love you, and we don't want to lose you.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>To help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics
         play such an important role in our society, but, unfortunately, some in
         professional sports are not setting much of an example. The use of
         performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and
         other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message -- that there
         are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that performance is more important
         than character. So tonight I call on team owners, union representatives,
         coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right signal, to get
         tough, and to get rid of steroids now. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers
         young people face -- even when they're difficult to talk about. Each
         year, about 3 million teenagers contract sexually-transmitted diseases
         that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever becoming
         parents. In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help inform
         families about these medical risks. We will double federal funding for
         abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence
         for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually-transmitted
         diseases. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for
         the rest of their lives. All of us -- parents and schools and government
         -- must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture,
         and to send the right messages to our children.</p>
      <p>A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe
         we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of
         the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization.
         Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense
         of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute
         protects marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman, and
         declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states.</p>
      <p>Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order,
         without regard for the will of the people and their elected
         representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's
         voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will
         upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the
         constitutional process. Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The outcome of this debate is important -- and so is the way we conduct
         it. The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that
         each individual has dignity and value in God's sight. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the
         compassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of
         every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country --
         mentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely.
         Yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to
         these groups, just because they have a cross or a Star of David or a
         crescent on the wall. By executive order, I have opened billions of
         dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based
         charities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of faith
         can know that the law will never discriminate against them again.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of
         prisoners, and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the
         homeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in
         need of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from
         prison back into society. We know from long experience that if they
         can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to commit
         crime and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a four-year, $300
         million prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job training and
         placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly
         released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups.
         (Applause.) America is the land of second chance, and when the gates of
         the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>For all Americans, the last three years have brought tests we did not
         ask for, and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown
         what kind of nation we are. In grief, we have found the grace to go on.
         In challenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people.
         In victory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America. And
         having come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart.</p>
      <p>I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who have
         shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness
         for the long haul. All of us have been partners in a great enterprise.
         And even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic
         times. Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter. It
         began, "Dear George W. Bush. If there's anything you know, I, Ashley
         Pearson, age 10, can do to help anyone, please send me a letter and tell
         me what I can do to save our country." She added this P.S.: "If you can
         send a letter to the troops, please put, 'Ashley Pearson believes in
         you.'" (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed. And,
         yes, you have some duties yourself. Study hard in school, listen to your
         mom or dad, help someone in need, and when you and your friends see a
         man or woman in uniform, say, "thank you." (Applause.) And, Ashley,
         while you do your part, all of us here in this great chamber will do our
         best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>My fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith. Our
         nation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it
         is the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is
         unmistakable -- and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can
         trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years. And
         in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true.</p>
      <p>May God continue to bless America. (Applause.)
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idFebruary_2,_2005" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>George W. Bush</h2>
      <h3>February 2, 2005</h3>
      <p>Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow
         citizens:</p>
      <p>As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of
         government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the
         votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share
         with newly-elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories,
         Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the
         commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This
         evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and
         around the world.</p>
      <p>Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back
         to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world -- the
         state of our union is confident and strong. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Our generation has been blessed -- by the expansion of opportunity, by
         advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents'
         sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror -- or a lot of
         gray -- (laughter) -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood,
         we ask the question: What will be the state of their union? Members of
         Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over
         the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans
         have always done, and build a better world for our children and our
         grandchildren. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">First, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great
            institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's
            economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In
            the past four years, we provided tax relief to every person who pays
            income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad,
            prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest
            level in history, and in the last year alone, the United States has
            added 2.3 million new jobs.</span> (Applause.) When action was needed, the
         Congress delivered -- and the nation is grateful.</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more
            flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America
            the economic leader of the world.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the
         federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending
         discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of
         discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and
         stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. (Applause.) My budget
         substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs
         that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not
         fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer
         dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising
            generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century.</span> Under the No Child Left
         Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're
         closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand
         better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a
         ticket to success. We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get
         training for a better career, by reforming our job training system and
         strengthening America's community colleges. And we'll make it easier for
         Americans to afford a college education, by increasing the size of Pell
         Grants. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward,
            not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs.</span> Small business is
         the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must
         free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest
         job-creators from junk lawsuits. (Applause.) Justice is distorted, and
         our economy is held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous
         asbestos claims -- and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health
            care more affordable, and give families greater access to good coverage
            -- (applause) -- and more control over their health decisions.
            (Applause.) </span><span class="poverty">I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health
            care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a

         reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have
         the doctors and care they need. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of
            affordable, environmentally responsible energy.</span> <span class="infra">(Applause.) Nearly four
            years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages
            conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and
            more production here at home -- including safe, clean nuclear energy.</span>
         (Applause.) My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution
         and improve the health of our citizens. (Applause.) And my budget
         provides strong funding for leading-edge technology -- from
         hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as
         ethanol. (Applause.) Four years of debate is enough: I urge Congress to
         pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on
         foreign energy. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new
            jobs -- but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the
            prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were
            created to meet the needs of an earlier time.</span> Year after year, Americans
         are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed
         a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when
         their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to
         give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and
         fair to all. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">America's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs
            of our economy and to the values of our country. </span>We should not be
         content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to
         provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and
         invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that
         permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take,
         that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our
         country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>One of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust
         between generations -- is also in need of wise and effective reform.
         Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we
         must honor its great purposes in this new century. (Applause.) The
         system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And
         so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits,
         and millions more are nearing retirement -- and for them the system is
         sound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55
         or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security
         system will not change in any way. (Applause.) For younger workers, the
         Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with
         time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era.
         In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were much lower
         than they are today. And a half-century ago, about sixteen workers paid
         into the system for each person drawing benefits.</p>
      <p>Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could
         not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and,
         therefore, drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to
         rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of sixteen
         workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three
         workers. And over the next few decades that number will fall to just two
         workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are
         paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.</p>
      <p>So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security
         will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will
         bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. <span class="economy">For example, in the
            year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra
            $200 billion to keep the system afloat -- and by 2033, the annual
            shortfall would be more than $300 billion.</span> By the year 2042, the entire
         system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert
         that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes,
         massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security
         benefits or other government programs.</p>
      <p>I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates
         are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a
         five-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college
         tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as
         some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire
         does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter
         to the United States Congress. (Applause.) You and I share a
         responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems
         of Social Security once and for all.</p>
      <p>Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review
         of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy
         retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of
         indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my
         predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age.
         Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of
         Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan
         recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. All these ideas
         are on the table.</p>
      <p>I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move
         ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement
         security is more important than partisan politics. (Applause.) I will
         work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of
         reforms. I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer.
         (Applause.) We must, however, be guided by some basic principles. We
         must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for
         another day. We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing
         payroll taxes. We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help
         they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. We must
         guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing
         retirement. And we must take care that any changes in the system are
         gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their
         future.</p>
      <p>As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the
         system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that
         goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. (Applause.) Here
         is how the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is
         taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of
         today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be
         able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so
         you can build a nest egg for your own future.</p>
      <p>Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will
         grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can
         deliver -- and your account will provide money for retirement over and
         above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition,
         you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal
         account, if you wish, to your children and -- or grandchildren. And best
         of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never
         take it away. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful
         guidelines for personal accounts. We'll make sure the money can only go
         into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that
         your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make
         sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden
         market swings on the eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal
         account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over
         time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll
         make sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal
         retirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on
         contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside
         four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.</p>
      <p>Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees,
         because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings
         Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any
         of five different broadly-based investment funds. It's time to extend
         the same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to
         honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many
         of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and
         faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children.
         Government is not the source of these values, but government should
         never undermine them.</p>
      <p>Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society,
         it should not be re-defined by activist judges. For the good of
         families, children, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to
         protect the institution of marriage. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable,
         we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us
         reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and
         help people overcome disabilities -- and I thank the Congress for
         doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. (Applause.)
         To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances
         always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the
         benefit of others. We should all be able to agree -- (applause) -- we
         should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with
         Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for
         experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never
         bought and sold as a commodity. (Applause.) America will continue to
         lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and
         always ethical.</p>
      <p>Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty
         to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.
         (Applause.) As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to
         nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our
         democracy, and are well-qualified to serve on the bench -- and I have
         done so. (Applause.) The Constitution also gives the Senate a
         responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must
         never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the
         opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support
         faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we
         need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our
         cities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. Tonight I propose
         a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of
         gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and
         rejects violence. (Applause.) Taking on gang life will be one part of a
         broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors,
         coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to
         sports. And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be
         our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you
         to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and provide
         care and treatment to the victims of that disease. (Applause.) And as we
         update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens
         with the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in
         equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and
         backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In
         America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a
         crime he or she did not commit -- so we are dramatically expanding the
         use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. (Applause.) Soon I
         will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense
         counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must
         have competent lawyers by their side. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an
         America that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. We will pass
         along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy -- and chief among them
         is freedom from fear.</p>
      <p><span class="war">In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we have
            taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new
            department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on
            preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken
            up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses
            against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and
            trained more than a half-million first responders</span>. Police and
         firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working
         every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the
            enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and
            continuing. The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still
            has leaders -- but many of its top commanders have been removed.</span> There
         are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists -- but their
         number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass
         destruction -- but no longer without attention and without consequence.
         Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and
         intimidate us all -- and we will stay on the offensive against them,
         until the fight is won. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror -- and I
            thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the
            resources they have needed. During this time of war, we must continue to
            support our military and give them the tools for victory. </span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an
            international force is helping provide security.</span> In Iraq, 28 countries
         have troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union
         provided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a
         mission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60
         governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative, to detect and stop
         the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the
         governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear
         ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have
         captured or detained al Qaeda terrorists. In the next four years, my
         administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat
         the dangers of our time. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>In the long-term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating
         the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole
         regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be
         the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America
         and other free nations for decades. The only force powerful enough to
         stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace hatred with hope, is
         the force of human freedom. (Applause.) Our enemies know this, and that
         is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the
         "evil principle" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention:
         America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic
         movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of
         ending tyranny in our world. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose
         our form of government on anyone else. That is one of the main
         differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand
         an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed
         rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and
         preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments
         that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures. And
         because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the
         advance of freedom will lead to peace. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>That advance has great momentum in our time -- shown by women voting in
         Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people
         of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president.
         We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the
         coming years, we will add to that story. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories
         are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence
         and failure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip
         that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime
         Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we
         and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the
         institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state.<span class="diplomacy"> To promote
            this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support
            Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. The goal of two
            democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace,
            is within reach -- and America will help them achieve that goal.</span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United
         States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common
         threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom.
         Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan
         to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its
         leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in
         determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which
         showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way
         toward democracy in the Middle East. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes
         that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder.
         Syria still allows its territory, and parts of Lebanon, to be used by
         terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. You
         have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act -- and
         we expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open
         the door to freedom. (Applause.) <span class="war">Today, Iran remains the world's primary
            state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its
            people of the freedom they seek and deserve.</span> We are working with
         European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up
         its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end
         its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you
         stand for your own liberty, America stands with you. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the
         Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a
         vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have
         chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting
         terrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home.
         (Applause.) And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new
         ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to
         Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby
         lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty -- as
         they showed the world last Sunday. (Applause.) Across Iraq, often at
         great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men
         and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A
         young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on
         election day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She
         said, "Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me -- the insurgents are
         weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing. So I got my
         husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."</p>
      <p>Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any
         nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for
         millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they
         have earned the respect of us all. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia
            Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, "We were occupied for 35 years
            by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the
            American people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers."</span>
         Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's
         intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able
         to vote for the leaders of her country -- and we are honored that she is
         with us tonight. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and
         will continue to attack it. Yet, the terrorists' most powerful myth is
         being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and
         assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to
         destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole
         world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the
         will of the Iraqi people. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their
         own freedom, and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi
         said in his speech to Congress last September, "Ordinary Iraqis are
         anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly
         as possible." That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and
         it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The new
         political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that
         country.</p>
      <p><span class="war">At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in
            consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our
            efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces -- forces
            with skilled officers and an effective command structure.</span> As those
         forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security
         responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly
         be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their
         own country -- and we will help that proud, new nation secure its
         liberty.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, "Tell America not to
            abandon us." He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military
            strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and
            unchanging. </span>We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and
         freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come.
         (Applause.) We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq,
         because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they
         can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is
         democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its
         neighbors, and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved,
         our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they
         have earned. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world,
            often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and
            equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character
            that makes every American proud. (Applause.) The volunteers of our
            military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in
            honor and decency, and every day they're making our nation more secure.
            Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and
            this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover.</span>
         (Applause.) And we have said farewell to some very good men and women,
         who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor
         forever.</p>
      <p><span class="war">One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of
            Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. </span>His
         mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a
         Marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She
         wrote, "When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to
         protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said,
         'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'" Ladies
         and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders, and
         our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant
         Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events.
         We have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of
         victory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen
         threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has
         reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We are
         all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our
         country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the
         peace that freedom brings.</p>
      <p>As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, "Each age is a dream that
         is dying, or one that is coming to birth." And we live in the country
         where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a
         dream -- until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism
         was only a dream -- until it was achieved. The fall of imperial
         communism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished. Our
         generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with
         confidence. The road of Providence is uneven and unpredictable -- yet we
         know where it leads: It leads to freedom.</p>
      <p>Thank you, and may God bless America. (Applause.)
         </p><a href="#top"><button id="idJanuary_31,_2006" type="button">Back to top of page</button></a><h2>George W. Bush</h2>
      <h3>January 31, 2006</h3>
      <p>Thank you all. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress,
         members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests,
         and fellow citizens: Today our nation lost a beloved, graceful,
         courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried
         on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion
         with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the
         good life of Coretta Scott King. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege,
         and mindful of the history we've seen together. We have gathered under
         this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national
         achievement. We have served America through one of the most
         consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to
         serve with you.</p>
      <p>In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches,
         there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can
         be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to
         harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act
         in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my
         part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will
         make it stronger. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both
         the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act
         confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our
         duties in the hope of an easier life. <span class="economy">We will choose to build our
            prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from
            trade and opportunity.</span> In a complex and challenging time, the road of
         isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting -- yet it
         ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only
         way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our
         leadership -- so the United States of America will continue to lead.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we
         seek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as
         misguided idealism. <span class="war">In reality, the future security of America depends
            on it. On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating
            in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and
            destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed
            resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction.
            Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their
            citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every
            step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer -- so we will
            act boldly in freedom's cause.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great
         story of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely
         democracies in the world. Today, there are 122. <span class="civil-rights">And we're writing a new
            chapter in the story of self-government -- with women lining up to vote
            in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple
            ink, and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of
            individuals and the necessity of freedom.</span> At the start of 2006, more
         than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. And we do
         not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe,
         North Korea, and Iran -- because the demands of justice, and the peace
         of this world, require their freedom, as well. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight
         against it. And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is
         radical Islam -- the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an
         ideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious
         about mass murder -- and all of us must take their declared intentions
         seriously. <span class="war">They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian
            control throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of
            mass murder.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe haven to
            launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military
            strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon
            of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up
            commuters in London, or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope
            these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the
            Earth. But they have miscalculated: We love our freedom, and we will
            fight to keep it.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our
         commitments and retreating within our borders. <span class="war">If we were to leave these
            vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would
            simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in
            retreat. And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to
            work its will -- by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself -- we
            would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even
            in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The
            United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never
            surrender to evil.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p>America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation
         that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped
         raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire.<span class="war"> Once again, we
            accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world
            toward peace. We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We
            have killed or captured many of their leaders -- and for the others,
            their day will come.</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a
            National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of
            a new democracy. We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for
            victory. First, we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so
            that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be
            marginalized.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy"><span class="war">Second, we're continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi
               government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis
               can experience the benefits of freedom. And, third, we're striking
               terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly
               capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every
               day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.</span></span>
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal. But that
            brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In
            less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to
            liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. At
            the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off
            terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning
            over territory to Iraqi security forces.</span> I am confident in our plan for
         victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident
         in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are in this
         fight to win, and we are winning. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we
            make progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the
            lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels -- but
            those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by
            politicians in Washington, D.C.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We've adjusted
            our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along
            the way, we have benefitted from responsible criticism and counsel
            offered by members of Congress of both parties</span>. In the coming year, I
         will continue to reach out and seek your good advice. Yet, there is a
         difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and
         defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. (Applause.)
         Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and second-guessing is not a strategy.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to
            speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would
            abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin
            Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a
            pledge from America means little. Members of Congress, however we feel
            about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one
            option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the
            American military in this vital mission.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices -- and showing a
            sense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight
            house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert
            heat, to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb. And those who know the
            costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed
            last month fighting in Fallujah. He left behind a letter to his family,
            but his words could just as well be addressed to every American. Here is
            what Dan wrote: "I know what honor is.   It has been an honor to protect
            and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledge that you
            would not have to . Never falter! Don't hesitate to honor and support
            those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth
            protecting."</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and
            Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome. (Applause.)</span></p>
      <p><span class="war">Our nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our
            country. We're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's
            uniform -- and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the
            sacrifices of America's military families.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our offensive against terror involves more than military action.
            Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their
            dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of
            political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America
            supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East.</span> Elections are
         vital, but they are only the beginning. Raising up a democracy requires
         the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable
         institutions that last longer than a single vote.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">The great people of Egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential
            election -- and now their government should open paths of peaceful
            opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism.</span> The Palestinian
         people have voted in elections. And now the leaders of Hamas must
         recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace.
         (Applause.) Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform -- now it
         can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those
         efforts. Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own,
         because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet
         liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because
         liberty is the right and hope of all humanity. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical
         elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that
         country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in
         Lebanon -- and that must come to an end. (Applause.) <span class="war">The Iranian
            government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the
            nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear
            weapons. (Applause.) America will continue to rally the world to
            confront these threats.</span></p>
      <p><span class="diplomacy">Tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects
            you, and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your
            own future and win your own freedom. And our nation hopes one day to be
            the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by
            encouraging economic progress, and fighting disease, and spreading hope
            in hopeless lands.</span> Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting
         enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need. We
         show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given
         dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with
         malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into
         slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by
         poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, and organized
         crime, and human trafficking, and the drug trade.</p>
      <p>In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS
         and malaria, <span class="civil-rights">expand the education of girls,</span> and reward developing
         nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. For
         people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life.
         Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of
         our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of
         our country. I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of
         America by showing the compassion of America.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at
            home. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.
            Fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement,
            intelligence, the military, and homeland security. These men and women
            are dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our
            support and our thanks.</span> (Applause.) They also deserve the same tools
         they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime -- so I
         ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our
            government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know
            that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to
            al Qaeda operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans
            until it was too late. So to prevent another attack  - based on
            authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have
            authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the
            international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and
            affiliates to and from America. Previous Presidents have used the same
            constitutional authority I have, and federal courts have approved the
            use of that authority. Appropriate members of Congress have been kept
            informed. The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent
            terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If
            there are people inside our country who are talking with al Qaeda, we
            want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit
            again.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="war">In all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory
            in Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions -- we
            need the support of our friends and allies. To draw that support, we
            must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. The only
            alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and
            anxious world</span>. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to
         serve the values that gave us birth. American leaders -- from Roosevelt
         to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat,
         because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on
         the march.</p>
      <p><span class="war">Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy -- a war
            that will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who will need steady
            bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours.
            Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who
            defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the
            prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in
            the world.</span></p>
      <p>
         <span class="economy">Our economy is healthy and vigorous, and growing faster than other major
            industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a-half years, America has
            created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European Union
            combined. (Applause.) Even in the face of higher energy prices and
            natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic
            performance that is the envy of the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be
            complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors,
            like China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it
            easier to feed people's fears. So we're seeing some old temptations
            return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we
            can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy.
            Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing
            the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes.
            We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy -- even
            though this economy could not function without them.</span> (Applause.) All
         these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction
         -- toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.</p>
      <p>
         Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that
         competes with confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living
         and generate new jobs. <span class="economy">Americans should not fear our economic future,
            because we intend to shape it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="economy">Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. And
            our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend,
            save, and invest. In the last five years, the tax relief you passed has
            left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small
            businesses, and families -- and they have used it to help produce more
            than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. </span>(Applause.) Yet the
         tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we do nothing,
         American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect
         and will not welcome.</p>
      <p>Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than
         temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly, and make
         the tax cuts permanent. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax
            dollars. Every year of my presidency, we've reduced the growth of
            non-security discretionary spending, and last year you passed bills that
            cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again, and reduce or
            eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not
            fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we will save
            the American taxpayer another $14 billion next year, and stay on track
            to cut the deficit in half by 2009. </span>(Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">I am pleased that members of Congress are working on earmark reform,
            because the federal budget has too many special interest projects.</span>
         (Applause.) And we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the
         line-item veto. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or
         entitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn
         60, including two of my Dad's favorite people -- me and President
         Clinton. (Laughter.) This milestone is more than a personal crisis --
         (laughter) -- it is a national challenge. The retirement of the baby
         boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal
         government. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid
         alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And that
         will present future Congresses with impossible choices -- staggering tax
         increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending.</p>
      <p>Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security --
         (applause) -- yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is
         not going away. (Applause.) And every year we fail to act, the situation
         gets worse.</p>
      <p>So tonight, I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the
         full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and
         Medicaid. This commission should include members of Congress of both
         parties, and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside partisan
         politics and work together and get this problem solved. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all
            that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in
            America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy
            American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can
            out-produce or out-compete the American worker.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds
            our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.</span>
         Our nation needs orderly and secure borders. (Applause.) To meet this
         goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border
         protection. (Applause.) And we must have a rational, humane guest worker
         program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for people who seek
         them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. (Applause.)
         Our government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor
         and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. (Applause.) For
         all Americans -- for all Americans, we must confront the rising cost of
         care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford
         the insurance coverage they need. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="infra">We will make wider use of electronic records and other health
            information technology, to help control costs and reduce dangerous
            medical errors.</span> We will strengthen health savings accounts -- making
         sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the
         same advantages that people working for big businesses now get.
         (Applause.) We will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers
         can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health
         insurance. (Applause.) And because lawsuits are driving many good
         doctors out of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American
         counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask the Congress to pass medical
         liability reform this year. (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="infra">Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have
            a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported
            from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction
            is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to
            develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources
            -- and we are on the threshold of incredible advances.</span></p>
      <p><span class="infra">So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22-percent
            increase in clean-energy research -- at the Department of Energy, to
            push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our
            homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired
            plants, revolutionary solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe
            nuclear energy.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="infra">We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our
            research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in
            pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. We'll also fund additional
            research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from
            corn, but from wood chips and stalks, or switch grass. Our goal is to
            make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six
            years.</span> (Applause.)</p>
      <p><span class="economy">Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach
            another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports
            from the Middle East by 2025.</span> (Applause.) By applying the talent and
         technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our
         environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy, and make our
         dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all:
         We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our
         greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated,
         hardworking, ambitious people -- and we're going to keep that edge.
         Tonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage
         innovation throughout our economy, and to give our nation's children a
         firm grounding in math and science. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical
         basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years.
         <span class="infra">This funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as
            they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and
            alternative energy sources.</span></p>
      <p>Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax
         credit -- (applause) -- to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives
         in technology. With more research in both the public and private
         sectors, we will improve our quality of life -- and ensure that America
         will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and
         to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other
         nations. We've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child
         Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores
         across our country. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school
         teachers to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science, bring
         30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give
         early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better
         chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's children
         succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us
         can share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness
         Initiative, and together we will show the world what the American people
         can achieve.</p>
      <p>America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness
         is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat
         one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful
         society.</p>
      <p>In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. Violent crime
         rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases
         have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among
         youth is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in
         America than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of
         children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a
         row. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation -- a revolution of
         conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of
         personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. Government has played
         a role. Wise policies, such as welfare reform and drug education and
         support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the
         character of our country. And everyone here tonight, Democrat and
         Republican, has a right to be proud of this record. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about
         the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic
         institutions. They're concerned about unethical conduct by public
         officials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine
         marriage. They worry about children in our society who need direction
         and love, and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster,
         and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.</p>
      <p>As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that
         America is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel. The
         American people know better than that. We have proven the pessimists
         wrong before -- and we will do it again. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the
         law. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new members on
         its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. (Applause.)
         I thank the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue to
         nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of
         the law, and not legislate from the bench. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24
         years of faithful service to our nation, the United States is grateful
         to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not
         cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every
         life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most
         egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms,
         creating or implanting embryos for experiments, creating human-animal
         hybrids, and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos. Human life is
         a gift from our Creator -- and that gift should never be discarded,
         devalued or put up for sale. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.
         (Applause.) Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to
         strengthen the ethical standards of Washington -- I support your
         efforts. Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public
         responsibility -- and that is a pledge we must never forget, never
         dismiss, and never betray. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the
         character of America in our compassion and care for one another.</p>
      <p>A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction
         and love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are
         encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child -- and
         this good work is being led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.)
         This year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in
         school, so more of America's youth can raise their sights and achieve
         their dreams.</p>
      <p>A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of
         suffering and emergency -- and stays at it until they're back on their
         feet. So far the federal government has committed $85 billion to the
         people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We're removing debris and
         repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing
         business loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet these immediate
         needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the
         storm arrived.</p>
      <p>In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have
         felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only
         temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills
         that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and
         start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for
         the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and
         rich in opportunity. (Applause.)</p>
      <p>A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can
         be prevented, and treated, and defeated. More than a million Americans
         live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans.
         I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act, and provide
         new funding to states, so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in
         America. (Applause.) We will also lead a nationwide effort, working
         closely with African American churches and faith-based groups, to
         deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS, and come
         closer to the day when there are no new infections in America.
         (Applause.)</p>
      <p>Fellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of
         consequence. We've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing
         to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that will
         influence all our lives. Sometimes it can seem that history is turning
         in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history
         is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes
         to a point of choosing.</p>
      <p><span class="civil-rights">Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued
            slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at
            Selma, and achieved only half a victory over segregation.</span> The United
         States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe, and been
         complicit in the oppression of others. Today, having come far in our own
         historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?</p>
      <p>Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like
         Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well.
         We will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global
         economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And
         so we move forward -- optimistic about our country, faithful to its
         cause, and confident of the victories to come.</p>
      <p>May God bless America. (Applause.)</p>
