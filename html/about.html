        <h1>About the State Of The Union Project</h1>
        <p>The State of the Union project is our group's attempt to analyze presidential State of the Union addresses to see what’s contained within them. What subjects do different presidents accentuate during their speeches? Do subjects wax and wane in importance over time and can we measure this change empirically? How much is the nature and content of a State of the Union address influenced by the context under which it was written? All of these are interesting questions that we hope to have come one step closer to answering with this project.</p>
            
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
            
            <p>To start our project, we decided to select a scope that was feasible for our time, manpower, and resources, and we also wanted to make sure that this scope also encompassed a group of addresses that would contain interesting and insightful data. This in mind, we decided to focus in on the most modern addresses included in the original Project Gutenberg text which we used for our project. This spanned from John F. Kennedy’s first address all the way to George W. Bush’s last. This left us with both a feasible scale for our means and an interesting variety of historical contexts.</p>
            
            <p>We began by performing manual .xml markup on the original text to parse out mentions of six specific subjects which we selected for their continued relevance over time. This list included:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>War</li>
               <li>Diplomacy</li>
               <li>Economics</li>
               <li>Poverty</li>
               <li>Infrastructure</li>
               <li>Civil Rights</li>
           </ul> 
            <p>Once we had these identified, we were able to utilize .xslt and .svg to perform calculations with this data and display this information that could be easily consumed and studied. The results of these efforts are displayed on this website.
